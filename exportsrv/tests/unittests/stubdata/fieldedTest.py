The lens antenna is made of an\nartificial material of metal particle. Comparing with our previous\nstudy, Anti-reflection (AR) layers are supplemented to the lens in this\nstudy to obtain a wave matching on the air-lens interface. The improved\nlens is in a disk shape of 50 mm diameter and 5.9 mm thickness. The lens\nis applied in a free-space setup, in which it is set in front of a patch\nantenna resonating at 15 GHz to get a high gain. The free-space setup is\nused to measure microwave attenuation and phase shift through a sawdust\nsample. The experimental results show that the multiple-reflection in\nthe free-space method becomes small, because the reflection on air-lens\ninterface has been reduced. The proposed AR lens antenna is flat and\nvery small in the size. It is possible to construct a very compact and\nlow cost free-space setup using the improved lens.\n%Y DOI: 10.1007/s11220-017-0166-7\n\n\n%R 2017wfc..rept...16R\n%T Possible Overlaps Between Blobs, Grism Apertures, and Dithers\n%A Ryan, R.

Each aperture was designed to place the science target (e.g. a\nspecific star) on a cosmetically clean area of the IR detector.\nSimilarly, the dither patterns were designed to mitigate cosmetic\ndefects by rarely (or ideally never) placing such targets on known\ndefects. Because blobs accumulate with time, the originally defined\napertures and dither patterns may no longer accomplish their goals, it\nis important to reverify these combinations. We find two potential\noverlaps between the blob, aperture, and dither combinations, but do not\nrecommend any changes to the current suite of aperture references\npositions and/or dither patterns for two reasons. First, one of the\noverlaps occurs with a dither/aperture combination that is seldom used\nfor high-value science operations, but rather more common for wide-field\nsurveys/mosaics. Second, the other overlap is 8.7 pix from a blob that\nhas a fiducial radius of 10 pix, which already represents a very\nconservative distance. We conclude that a similar analysis should be\nrepeated as new blobs occur, to continue to ensure ideal operations for\nhigh-value science targets. The purpose of this report is to document\nthe analysis in order to facilitate its repetition in the future.\n\n\n%R 2017PhDT........14C\n%T Resolving Gas-Phase Metallicity In Galaxies\n%A Carton, David\n%F AA(Leiden University)\n%J Ph.D. Thesis\n%D 06/2017\n%K galaxies: evolution, galaxies: abundances, galaxies: ISM\n%I ABSTRACT: Abstract;\n%I REFERENCES: References in the Article;\n%I Co-Reads: Co-Reads;\n%I PUB_HTML: Publisher Article;\n%U https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017PhDT........14C\n%B Chapter 2: As part of the Bluedisk survey we analyse the radial gas-\nphase metallicity profiles of 50 late-type galaxies. We compare the\nmetallicity profiles of a sample of HI-rich galaxies against a control\nsample of HI-\'normal\' galaxies. We find the metallicity gradient of a\ngalaxy to be strongly correlated with its HI mass fraction {M}{HI}) /\n{M}_{\\ast}). We note that some galaxies exhibit a steeper metallicity\nprofile in the outer disc than in the inner disc. These galaxies are\nfound in both the HI-rich and control samples. This contradicts a\nprevious indication that these outer drops are exclusive to HI-rich\ngalaxies. These effects are not driven by bars, although we do find some\nindication that barred galaxies have flatter metallicity profiles. By\napplying a simple analytical model we are able to account for the\nvariety of metallicity profiles that the two samples present. The\nsuccess of this model implies that the metallicity in these isolated\ngalaxies may be in a local equilibrium, regulated by star formation.\nThis insight could provide an explanation of the observed local mass-\nmetallicity relation. Chapter 3 We present a method to recover the gas-\nphase metallicity gradients from integral field spectroscopic (IFS)\nobservations of barely resolved galaxies. We take a forward modelling\napproach and compare our models to the observed spatial distribution of\nemission line fluxes, accounting for the degrading effects of seeing and\nspatial binning. The method is flexible and is not limited to particular\nemission lines or instruments. We test the model through comparison to\nsynthetic observations and use downgraded observations of nearby\ngalaxies to validate this work. As a proof of concept we also apply the\nmodel to real IFS observations of high-redshift galaxies. From our\ntesting we show that the inferred metallicity gradients and central\nmetallicities are fairly insensitive to the assumptions made in the\nmodel and that they are reliably recovered for galaxies with sizes\napproximately equal to the half width at half maximum of the point-\nspread function. However, we also find that the presence of star forming\nclumps can significantly complicate the interpretation of metallicity\ngradients in moderately resolved high-redshift galaxies. Therefore we\nemphasize that care should be taken when comparing nearby well-resolved\nobservations to high-redshift observations of partially resolved\ngalaxies. Chapter 4 We present gas-phase metallicity gradients for 94\nstar-forming galaxies between (0.08 < z < 0.84). We find a negative\nmedian metallicity gradient of (-0.043^{+0.009}_{-0.007},\ndex/kpc)/span>, i.e. on average we find the centres of these galaxies to\nbe more metal-rich than their outskirts. However, there is significant\nscatter underlying this and we find that 10% (9) galaxies have\nsignificantly positive metallicity gradients, 39% (37) have\nsignificantly negative gradients, 28% (26) have gradients consistent\nwith being flat, the remainder 23% (22) are considered to have\nunreliable gradient estimates. We find a slight trend for a more\nnegative metallicity gradient with both increasing stellar mass and\nincreasing star formation rate (SFR). However, given the potential\nredshift and size selection effects, we do not consider these trends to\nbe significant. Indeed when we normalize the SFR of our galaxies\nrelative to the main sequence, we do not observe any trend between the\nmetallicity gradient and the normalized SFR. This finding is contrary to\nother recent studies of galaxies at similar and higher redshifts. We do,\nhowever, identify a novel trend between the metallicity gradient of a\ngalaxy and its size. Small galaxies ((r_d < 3 kpc)) present a large\nspread in observed metallicity gradients (both negative and positive\ngradients). In contrast, we find no large galaxies (r_d > 3 kpc) with\npositive metallicity gradients, and overall there is less scatter in the\nmetallicity gradient amongst the large galaxies. We suggest that these\nlarge (well-evolved) galaxies may be analogues of galaxies in the\npresent-day Universe, which also present a common negative metallicity\ngradient. Chapter 5 The relationship between a galaxy\'s stellar mass and\nits gas-phase metallicity results from the complex interplay between\nstar formation and the inflow and outflow of gas. Since the gradient of\nmetals in galaxies is also influenced by the same processes, it is\ntherefore natural to contrast the metallicity gradient with the mass-\nmetallicity relation. Here we study the interrelation of the stellar\nmass, central metallicity and metallicity gradient, using a sample of 72\ngalaxies spanning (0.13 < z < 0.84) with reliable metallicity gradient\nestimates. We find that typically the galaxies that fall below the mean\nmass-metallicity relation have flat or inverted metallicity gradients.\nWe quantify their relationship taking full account of the covariance\nbetween the different variables and find that at fixed mass the central\nmetallicity is anti-correlated with the metallicity gradient. We argue\nthat this is consistent with a scenario that suppresses the central\nmetallicity either through the inflow of metal poor gas or outflow of\nmetal enriched gas.\n%Y DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.581221\n\n\n%R 2017ascl.soft06009C\n%T sick: Spectroscopic inference crank\n%A Casey, Andrew R.\n%F AA(-)\n%J Astrophysics Source Code Library\n%D 06/2017\n%P ascl:1706.009\n%K Software\n%I ABSTRACT: Abstract;\n%I Co-Reads: Co-Reads;\n%I PUB_HTML: Publisher Article;\n%U https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017ascl.soft06009C\n%B sick infers astrophysical parameters from noisy observed spectra.\nPhenomena that can alter the data (e.g., redshift, continuum,\ninstrumental broadening, outlier pixels) are modeled and simultaneously\ninferred with the astrophysical parameters of interest.

Magenta regions have redshifted line-of-sight\nvelocities (moving away from us); cyan regions have blueshifted light-\nof-sight velocities (moving toward us). [Williams et al. 2017]The Tycho\nsupernova remnant was first observed in the year 1572. Nearly 450 years\nlater, astronomers have now used X-ray observations of Tycho to build\nthe first-ever 3D map of a Type Ia supernova remnant.Signs of\nExplosionsSupernova remnants are spectacular structures formed by the\nejecta of stellar explosions as they expand outwards into the\nsurrounding interstellar medium.One peculiarity of these remnants is\nthat they often exhibit asymmetries in their appearance and motion. Is\nthis because the ejecta are expanding into a nonuniform interstellar\nmedium? Or was the explosion itself asymmetric? The best way we can\nexplore this question is with detailed observations of the\nremnants.Histograms of the velocity in distribution of the knots in the\nX (green), Y (blue) and Z (red) directions (+Z is away from the\nobserver). They show no evidence for asymmetric expansion of the knots.\n[Williams et al. 2017]Enter TychoTo this end, a team of scientists led\nby Brian Williams (Space Telescope Science Institute and NASA Goddard\nSFC) has worked to map out the 3D velocities of the ejecta in the Tycho\nsupernova remnant. Tycho is a Type Ia supernova thought to be caused by\nthe thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf in a binary system that was\ndestabilized by mass transfer from its companion.After 450 years of\nexpansion, the remnant now has the morphological appearance of a roughly\ncircular cloud of clumpy ejecta. The forward shock wave from the\nsupernova, however, is known to have twice the velocity on one side of\nthe shell as on the other.To better understand this asymmetry, Williams\nand collaborators selected a total of 57 knots in Tychos ejecta, spread\nout around the remnant. They then used 12 years of Chandra X-ray\nobservations to measure both the knots proper motion in the plane of the\nsky and their line-of-sight velocity. These two measurements were then\ncombined to build a full 3D map of the motion of the ejecta.3D\nhydrodynamical simulations of Tycho, stopped at the current epoch. These\nshow that both initially smooth (top) and initially clumpy (bottom)\nejecta models are consistent with the current observations of the\nmorphology and dynamics of Tychos ejecta. [Adapted from Williams et al.\n2017]Symmetry and ClumpsWilliams and collaborators found that the knots\nhave total velocities that range from 2400 to 6600 km/s. Unlike the\nforward shock of the supernova, Tychos ejecta display no asymmetries in\ntheir motion which suggests that the explosion itself was symmetric. The\nmore likely explanation is a density gradient in the interstellar\nmedium, which could slow the shock wave on one side of the remnant\nwithout yet affecting the motion of the clumps of ejecta.As a final\nexploration, the authors attempt to address the origin of Tychos\nclumpiness. The fact that some of Tychos ejecta knots precede its outer\nedge has raised the question of whether the ejecta started out clumpy,\nor if they began smooth and only clumped during expansion. Williams and\ncollaborators matched the morphological and dynamical data to\nsimulations, demonstrating that neither scenario can be ruled out at\nthis time.This first 3D map of a Type Ia supernova represents an\nimportant step in our ability to understand these stellar explosions.\nThe authors suggest that well be able to expand on this map in the\nfuture with additional observations from Chandra, as well as with new\ndata from future X-ray observatories that will be able to detect fainter\nemission.CitationBrian J.

Spectroscopy on a cadence of a week or two is\nrequested to monitor changes in the disk outflow. Investigator Adrian\nLucy writes: "Adrian Lucy and Dr. Jeno Sokoloski (Columbia University)\nhave requested spectroscopic monitoring of the broad-absorption-line\nsymbiotic star V694 Mon (MWC 560), as a follow-up to coordinated multi-\nwavelength observations obtained during its recent outburst (ATel #8653,\n#8832, #8957; #10281). This system is a perfect place in which to study\nthe relationship between an accretion disk and disk winds/jets, and a\nhigh-value target for which even low-resolution spectra can be\nextraordinarily useful...Optical brightening in MWC 560 tends to predict\nhigher-velocity absorption, but sometimes jumps in absorption velocity\nalso appear during optical quiescence (e.g., Iijima 2001, ASPCS, 242,\n187). If such a velocity jump occurs during photometric quiescence, it\nmay prompt radio observations to confirm and test the proposed outflow\norigin for recently-discovered flat-spectrum radio emission (Lucy et al.\nATel #10281)...Furthermore, volunteer spectroscopic monitoring of this\nsystem has proved useful in unpredictable ways. For example, \'amateur\'\nspectra obtained by Somogyi P\\u00c3\\u00a9ter in 2015 December\ndemonstrated that the velocity of absorption was very low only a month\nbefore an optical outburst peak prompted absorption troughs up to 3000\nkm/s, which constrains very well the timing of the changes to the\noutflow to a degree that would not have been otherwise possible. Any\nresolution can be useful. A wavelength range that can accommodate a\nblueshift of at least 140 angstroms (6000 km/s) from the rest\nwavelengths of H-alpha at 6562 angstroms and/or H-beta at 4861 angstroms\nis ideal, though spectra with a smaller range can still be useful.\nPhotometry could potentially still be useful, but will be supplementary\nto medium-cadence photometry being collected by the ANS collaboration."\n"Spectroscopy may be uploaded to the ARAS database\n(http://www.astrosurf.com/aras/Aras_DataBase/DataBase.htm), or sent to\nAdrian and Jeno directly at <lucy@astro.columbia.edu>.

In early 2017, using archival\nWISE data, we discovered that its 3.4 and 4.6um fluxes have been\nsteadily rising since 2013, increased by a factor of 3.5 and 2.6\nrespectively. The last epoch data from WISE on 2016-12-12 shows that\nF01004-2237 has reached 7.5 and 14mJy at 3.4 and 4.6um. We interpret the\nmid-IR LCs as infrared echoes from the earlier optical flare. We infer a\nconvex, dust ring with a radius of 1 pc from the central heating source.\nOur model predicts that if this event is indeed a TDE, its mid-IR LCs\nshould start to fade in next 5-12 months because it has already\nreprocessed most of the UV/optical energy from the tidal disruption.\nHowever, if this event is due to activities from an AGN, its mid-IR LCs\ncould last over a much longer time scale. We request a total of 3.2\nhours of Spitzer time to monitor the mid-IR variations in next 12\nmonths. This will provide the critical data to confirm the nature of\nthis transient event.\n\n\n%R 2017MsT..........2A\n%T Surface Accuracy and Pointing Error Prediction of a 32 m Diameter Class Radio Astronomy Telescope\n%A Azankpo, Severin\n%F AA(University of Stellenbosch)\n%J Masters Thesis\n%D 03/2017\n%P 2\n%I ABSTRACT: Abstract;\n%I REFERENCES: References in the Article;\n%I PUB_HTML: Publisher Article;\n%I AUTHOR_PDF: Author PDF;\n%I PUB_PDF: Publisher PDF;\n%U https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017MsT..........2A\n%B The African Very-long-baseline interferometry Network (AVN) is a joint\nproject between South Africa and eight partner African countries aimed\nat establishing a VLBI (Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry) capable\nnetwork of radio telescopes across the African continent. An existing\nstructure that is earmarked for this project, is a 32 m diameter antenna\nlocated in Ghana that has become obsolete due to advances in\ntelecommunication. The first phase of the conversion of this Ghana\nantenna into a radio astronomy telescope is to upgrade the antenna to\nobserve at 5 GHz to 6.7 GHz frequency and then later to 18 GHz within a\nrequired performing tolerance. The surface and pointing accuracies for a\nradio telescope are much more stringent than that of a telecommunication\nantenna. The mechanical pointing accuracy of such telescopes is\ninfluenced by factors such as mechanical alignment, structural\ndeformation, and servo drive train errors. The current research\ninvestigates the numerical simulation of the surface and pointing\naccuracies of the Ghana 32 m diameter radio astronomy telescope due to\nits structural deformation mainly influenced by gravity, wind and\nthermal loads.\n\n\n%R 2016emo6.rept.....R\n%T The penumbral Moon\'s eclipse form 16 september 2016\n%A Rotaru, Adrian;Pteancu, Mircea;Zaharia, Cristian\n%F AA(Bragadiru, Romania), AB(Private Astronomical Observatory, Arad,\nRomania), AC(Private Astronomical Observatory, Ploiesti, Romania)\n%J http://www.astronomy.ro/forum/viewtopic.php?p=159287#159287 (Comments in Romanian\n%D 10/2016\n%K THE MOON, ECLIPSES, PARTIAL, PENUMBRAL, ASTROPHOTOGRAPHY\n%I ABSTRACT: Abstract;\n%I Co-Reads: Co-Reads;\n%U https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2016emo6.rept.....R\n%B The web page represents circumstances and photographs from the Moon\'s\npartial/penumbral eclipse from 16 September 2016 obtained from few\nvarious places in Romania (East Europe).

As four photometric bandpasses are\nutilized in nearly simultaneously, PQ is well suited to search for\ntransient and highly variable objects. Using a series of software\nfilters i.e. programs to select/deselect objects based on certain\ncriteria we shorten the list of candidates from the initially flagged\ncandidate transients. Such filters include looking for known asteroids,\nknown variables, as well as moving, but previously uncatalogued objects\nbased on their motion within a scan as well as between successive scans.\nSome software filters also deal with instrumental artifacts, edge\neffects, and use clustering of spurious detections around bright stars.\nDuring a typical night when we cover about 500 sq. degrees, we detect\nhundreds of asteroids, the primary contaminants in the search for\nastrophysical transients beyond our solar system. Here we describe some\nstatistics based on the software filters we employ and the nature of the\nobjects that seem to survive the process. We also discuss the usefulness\nof this to amateur astronomers, projects like VOEventNet, and other\nsynoptic sky surveys. We also present an outline of the work we have\nstarted on quantifying the variability of quasars, blazars, as well as\nvarious classes of Galactic sources, by combining the large number of PQ\nscans with other existing data sources federated in the Virtual\nObservatory environment. The PQ survey is partially supported by the\nU.S. National Science Foundation (NSF).\n\n\n%R 2007RJPh....1...35.\n%T Analysis of Thermal Losses in the Flat-Plate Collector of a Thermosyphon Solar Water Heater\n%A ., S.

Technical requirements for different mission trajectories and\norbits are addressed with consideration given to the various tradeoffs\nwhich may need to be considered. The broad spectrum of spacecraft are\nconsidered with emphasis upon those of greater military significance\n(i.e., near earth orbiting satellites). Technical requirements include,\nbut are not limited to, accuracy; physical characteristics such as\nweight and volume; support requirements such as electrical power and\nground support; and system integrity. Generic navigation suites for\nspacecraft applications are described. It is shown that operational\nspacecraft rely primarily upon ground-based tracking and computational\ncenters with little or no navigational function allocated to the\nvehicle, while technology development efforts have been and continue to\nbe directed primarily toward onboard navigation suites. The military\nsignificance of onboard navigators is shown to both improve spacecraft\nsurvivability and performance (accuracy).\n\n\n%R 1995anda.book.....N\n%T Applied nonlinear dynamics: analytical, computational and experimental methods\n%A Nayfeh, Ali H.;Balachandran, Balakumar\n%F AA(-), AB(-)\n%J Wiley series in nonlinear science\n%D 01/1995\n%I CITATIONS: Citations to the Article;\n%I Co-Reads: Co-Reads;\n%U https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/1995anda.book.....N\n\n\n%R 1983aiaa.meetY....K\n%T Autonomous navigation using lunar beacons\n%A Khatib, A.

Two beacons could be soft-landed on the\nlunar surface at the limits of allowable separation and each would\ntransmit a wide-beam signal with cones reaching GEO heights and be\nstrong enough to be received by small antennae in near-earth orbit. The\nblack box processor would perform on-board computation with one-way\nDoppler/range data and dynamical models.

The lens antenna is made of an\nartificial material of metal particle. Comparing with our previous\nstudy, Anti-reflection (AR) layers are supplemented to the lens in this\nstudy to obtain a wave matching on the air-lens interface. The improved\nlens is in a disk shape of 50 mm diameter and 5.9 mm thickness. The lens\nis applied in a free-space setup, in which it is set in front of a patch\nantenna resonating at 15 GHz to get a high gain. The free-space setup is\nused to measure microwave attenuation and phase shift through a sawdust\nsample. The experimental results show that the multiple-reflection in\nthe free-space method becomes small, because the reflection on air-lens\ninterface has been reduced. The proposed AR lens antenna is flat and\nvery small in the size. It is possible to construct a very compact and\nlow cost free-space setup using the improved lens.\n%3 10.1007/s11220-017-0166-7\n\n\n%0 Report\n%T Possible Overlaps Between Blobs, Grism Apertures, and Dithers\n%A Ryan, R.

Each aperture was designed to place the science target (e.g. a\nspecific star) on a cosmetically clean area of the IR detector.\nSimilarly, the dither patterns were designed to mitigate cosmetic\ndefects by rarely (or ideally never) placing such targets on known\ndefects. Because blobs accumulate with time, the originally defined\napertures and dither patterns may no longer accomplish their goals, it\nis important to reverify these combinations. We find two potential\noverlaps between the blob, aperture, and dither combinations, but do not\nrecommend any changes to the current suite of aperture references\npositions and/or dither patterns for two reasons. First, one of the\noverlaps occurs with a dither/aperture combination that is seldom used\nfor high-value science operations, but rather more common for wide-field\nsurveys/mosaics. Second, the other overlap is 8.7 pix from a blob that\nhas a fiducial radius of 10 pix, which already represents a very\nconservative distance. We conclude that a similar analysis should be\nrepeated as new blobs occur, to continue to ensure ideal operations for\nhigh-value science targets. The purpose of this report is to document\nthe analysis in order to facilitate its repetition in the future.\n\n\n%0 Thesis\n%T Resolving Gas-Phase Metallicity In Galaxies\n%A Carton, David\n%+ AA(Leiden University)\n%B Ph.D. Thesis\n%D 2017\n%8 June 01, 2017\n%K galaxies: evolution; galaxies: abundances; galaxies: ISM\n%U https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017PhDT........14C\n%X Chapter 2: As part of the Bluedisk survey we analyse the radial gas-\nphase metallicity profiles of 50 late-type galaxies. We compare the\nmetallicity profiles of a sample of HI-rich galaxies against a control\nsample of HI-\'normal\' galaxies. We find the metallicity gradient of a\ngalaxy to be strongly correlated with its HI mass fraction {M}{HI}) /\n{M}_{\\ast}). We note that some galaxies exhibit a steeper metallicity\nprofile in the outer disc than in the inner disc. These galaxies are\nfound in both the HI-rich and control samples. This contradicts a\nprevious indication that these outer drops are exclusive to HI-rich\ngalaxies. These effects are not driven by bars, although we do find some\nindication that barred galaxies have flatter metallicity profiles. By\napplying a simple analytical model we are able to account for the\nvariety of metallicity profiles that the two samples present. The\nsuccess of this model implies that the metallicity in these isolated\ngalaxies may be in a local equilibrium, regulated by star formation.\nThis insight could provide an explanation of the observed local mass-\nmetallicity relation. Chapter 3 We present a method to recover the gas-\nphase metallicity gradients from integral field spectroscopic (IFS)\nobservations of barely resolved galaxies. We take a forward modelling\napproach and compare our models to the observed spatial distribution of\nemission line fluxes, accounting for the degrading effects of seeing and\nspatial binning. The method is flexible and is not limited to particular\nemission lines or instruments. We test the model through comparison to\nsynthetic observations and use downgraded observations of nearby\ngalaxies to validate this work. As a proof of concept we also apply the\nmodel to real IFS observations of high-redshift galaxies. From our\ntesting we show that the inferred metallicity gradients and central\nmetallicities are fairly insensitive to the assumptions made in the\nmodel and that they are reliably recovered for galaxies with sizes\napproximately equal to the half width at half maximum of the point-\nspread function. However, we also find that the presence of star forming\nclumps can significantly complicate the interpretation of metallicity\ngradients in moderately resolved high-redshift galaxies. Therefore we\nemphasize that care should be taken when comparing nearby well-resolved\nobservations to high-redshift observations of partially resolved\ngalaxies. Chapter 4 We present gas-phase metallicity gradients for 94\nstar-forming galaxies between (0.08 < z < 0.84). We find a negative\nmedian metallicity gradient of (-0.043^{+0.009}_{-0.007},\ndex/kpc)/span>, i.e. on average we find the centres of these galaxies to\nbe more metal-rich than their outskirts. However, there is significant\nscatter underlying this and we find that 10% (9) galaxies have\nsignificantly positive metallicity gradients, 39% (37) have\nsignificantly negative gradients, 28% (26) have gradients consistent\nwith being flat, the remainder 23% (22) are considered to have\nunreliable gradient estimates. We find a slight trend for a more\nnegative metallicity gradient with both increasing stellar mass and\nincreasing star formation rate (SFR). However, given the potential\nredshift and size selection effects, we do not consider these trends to\nbe significant. Indeed when we normalize the SFR of our galaxies\nrelative to the main sequence, we do not observe any trend between the\nmetallicity gradient and the normalized SFR. This finding is contrary to\nother recent studies of galaxies at similar and higher redshifts. We do,\nhowever, identify a novel trend between the metallicity gradient of a\ngalaxy and its size. Small galaxies ((r_d < 3 kpc)) present a large\nspread in observed metallicity gradients (both negative and positive\ngradients). In contrast, we find no large galaxies (r_d > 3 kpc) with\npositive metallicity gradients, and overall there is less scatter in the\nmetallicity gradient amongst the large galaxies. We suggest that these\nlarge (well-evolved) galaxies may be analogues of galaxies in the\npresent-day Universe, which also present a common negative metallicity\ngradient. Chapter 5 The relationship between a galaxy\'s stellar mass and\nits gas-phase metallicity results from the complex interplay between\nstar formation and the inflow and outflow of gas. Since the gradient of\nmetals in galaxies is also influenced by the same processes, it is\ntherefore natural to contrast the metallicity gradient with the mass-\nmetallicity relation. Here we study the interrelation of the stellar\nmass, central metallicity and metallicity gradient, using a sample of 72\ngalaxies spanning (0.13 < z < 0.84) with reliable metallicity gradient\nestimates. We find that typically the galaxies that fall below the mean\nmass-metallicity relation have flat or inverted metallicity gradients.\nWe quantify their relationship taking full account of the covariance\nbetween the different variables and find that at fixed mass the central\nmetallicity is anti-correlated with the metallicity gradient. We argue\nthat this is consistent with a scenario that suppresses the central\nmetallicity either through the inflow of metal poor gas or outflow of\nmetal enriched gas.\n%3 10.5281/zenodo.581221\n\n\n%0 Miscellaneous\n%T sick: Spectroscopic inference crank\n%A Casey, Andrew R.\n%+ AA(-)\n%B Astrophysics Source Code Library\n%D 2017\n%8 June 01, 2017\n%K Software\n%U https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017ascl.soft06009C\n%X sick infers astrophysical parameters from noisy observed spectra.\nPhenomena that can alter the data (e.g., redshift, continuum,\ninstrumental broadening, outlier pixels) are modeled and simultaneously\ninferred with the astrophysical parameters of interest.

Magenta regions have redshifted line-of-sight\nvelocities (moving away from us); cyan regions have blueshifted light-\nof-sight velocities (moving toward us). [Williams et al. 2017]The Tycho\nsupernova remnant was first observed in the year 1572. Nearly 450 years\nlater, astronomers have now used X-ray observations of Tycho to build\nthe first-ever 3D map of a Type Ia supernova remnant.Signs of\nExplosionsSupernova remnants are spectacular structures formed by the\nejecta of stellar explosions as they expand outwards into the\nsurrounding interstellar medium.One peculiarity of these remnants is\nthat they often exhibit asymmetries in their appearance and motion. Is\nthis because the ejecta are expanding into a nonuniform interstellar\nmedium? Or was the explosion itself asymmetric? The best way we can\nexplore this question is with detailed observations of the\nremnants.Histograms of the velocity in distribution of the knots in the\nX (green), Y (blue) and Z (red) directions (+Z is away from the\nobserver). They show no evidence for asymmetric expansion of the knots.\n[Williams et al. 2017]Enter TychoTo this end, a team of scientists led\nby Brian Williams (Space Telescope Science Institute and NASA Goddard\nSFC) has worked to map out the 3D velocities of the ejecta in the Tycho\nsupernova remnant. Tycho is a Type Ia supernova thought to be caused by\nthe thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf in a binary system that was\ndestabilized by mass transfer from its companion.After 450 years of\nexpansion, the remnant now has the morphological appearance of a roughly\ncircular cloud of clumpy ejecta. The forward shock wave from the\nsupernova, however, is known to have twice the velocity on one side of\nthe shell as on the other.To better understand this asymmetry, Williams\nand collaborators selected a total of 57 knots in Tychos ejecta, spread\nout around the remnant. They then used 12 years of Chandra X-ray\nobservations to measure both the knots proper motion in the plane of the\nsky and their line-of-sight velocity. These two measurements were then\ncombined to build a full 3D map of the motion of the ejecta.3D\nhydrodynamical simulations of Tycho, stopped at the current epoch. These\nshow that both initially smooth (top) and initially clumpy (bottom)\nejecta models are consistent with the current observations of the\nmorphology and dynamics of Tychos ejecta. [Adapted from Williams et al.\n2017]Symmetry and ClumpsWilliams and collaborators found that the knots\nhave total velocities that range from 2400 to 6600 km/s. Unlike the\nforward shock of the supernova, Tychos ejecta display no asymmetries in\ntheir motion which suggests that the explosion itself was symmetric. The\nmore likely explanation is a density gradient in the interstellar\nmedium, which could slow the shock wave on one side of the remnant\nwithout yet affecting the motion of the clumps of ejecta.As a final\nexploration, the authors attempt to address the origin of Tychos\nclumpiness. The fact that some of Tychos ejecta knots precede its outer\nedge has raised the question of whether the ejecta started out clumpy,\nor if they began smooth and only clumped during expansion. Williams and\ncollaborators matched the morphological and dynamical data to\nsimulations, demonstrating that neither scenario can be ruled out at\nthis time.This first 3D map of a Type Ia supernova represents an\nimportant step in our ability to understand these stellar explosions.\nThe authors suggest that well be able to expand on this map in the\nfuture with additional observations from Chandra, as well as with new\ndata from future X-ray observatories that will be able to detect fainter\nemission.CitationBrian J.

Spectroscopy on a cadence of a week or two is\nrequested to monitor changes in the disk outflow. Investigator Adrian\nLucy writes: "Adrian Lucy and Dr. Jeno Sokoloski (Columbia University)\nhave requested spectroscopic monitoring of the broad-absorption-line\nsymbiotic star V694 Mon (MWC 560), as a follow-up to coordinated multi-\nwavelength observations obtained during its recent outburst (ATel #8653,\n#8832, #8957; #10281). This system is a perfect place in which to study\nthe relationship between an accretion disk and disk winds/jets, and a\nhigh-value target for which even low-resolution spectra can be\nextraordinarily useful...Optical brightening in MWC 560 tends to predict\nhigher-velocity absorption, but sometimes jumps in absorption velocity\nalso appear during optical quiescence (e.g., Iijima 2001, ASPCS, 242,\n187). If such a velocity jump occurs during photometric quiescence, it\nmay prompt radio observations to confirm and test the proposed outflow\norigin for recently-discovered flat-spectrum radio emission (Lucy et al.\nATel #10281)...Furthermore, volunteer spectroscopic monitoring of this\nsystem has proved useful in unpredictable ways. For example, \'amateur\'\nspectra obtained by Somogyi P\\u00c3\\u00a9ter in 2015 December\ndemonstrated that the velocity of absorption was very low only a month\nbefore an optical outburst peak prompted absorption troughs up to 3000\nkm/s, which constrains very well the timing of the changes to the\noutflow to a degree that would not have been otherwise possible. Any\nresolution can be useful. A wavelength range that can accommodate a\nblueshift of at least 140 angstroms (6000 km/s) from the rest\nwavelengths of H-alpha at 6562 angstroms and/or H-beta at 4861 angstroms\nis ideal, though spectra with a smaller range can still be useful.\nPhotometry could potentially still be useful, but will be supplementary\nto medium-cadence photometry being collected by the ANS collaboration."\n"Spectroscopy may be uploaded to the ARAS database\n(http://www.astrosurf.com/aras/Aras_DataBase/DataBase.htm), or sent to\nAdrian and Jeno directly at <lucy@astro.columbia.edu>.

In early 2017, using archival\nWISE data, we discovered that its 3.4 and 4.6um fluxes have been\nsteadily rising since 2013, increased by a factor of 3.5 and 2.6\nrespectively. The last epoch data from WISE on 2016-12-12 shows that\nF01004-2237 has reached 7.5 and 14mJy at 3.4 and 4.6um. We interpret the\nmid-IR LCs as infrared echoes from the earlier optical flare. We infer a\nconvex, dust ring with a radius of 1 pc from the central heating source.\nOur model predicts that if this event is indeed a TDE, its mid-IR LCs\nshould start to fade in next 5-12 months because it has already\nreprocessed most of the UV/optical energy from the tidal disruption.\nHowever, if this event is due to activities from an AGN, its mid-IR LCs\ncould last over a much longer time scale. We request a total of 3.2\nhours of Spitzer time to monitor the mid-IR variations in next 12\nmonths. This will provide the critical data to confirm the nature of\nthis transient event.\n\n\n%0 Thesis\n%T Surface Accuracy and Pointing Error Prediction of a 32 m Diameter Class Radio Astronomy Telescope\n%A Azankpo, Severin\n%+ AA(University of Stellenbosch)\n%B Masters Thesis\n%D 2017\n%8 March 01, 2017\n%U https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017MsT..........2A\n%X The African Very-long-baseline interferometry Network (AVN) is a joint\nproject between South Africa and eight partner African countries aimed\nat establishing a VLBI (Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry) capable\nnetwork of radio telescopes across the African continent. An existing\nstructure that is earmarked for this project, is a 32 m diameter antenna\nlocated in Ghana that has become obsolete due to advances in\ntelecommunication. The first phase of the conversion of this Ghana\nantenna into a radio astronomy telescope is to upgrade the antenna to\nobserve at 5 GHz to 6.7 GHz frequency and then later to 18 GHz within a\nrequired performing tolerance. The surface and pointing accuracies for a\nradio telescope are much more stringent than that of a telecommunication\nantenna. The mechanical pointing accuracy of such telescopes is\ninfluenced by factors such as mechanical alignment, structural\ndeformation, and servo drive train errors. The current research\ninvestigates the numerical simulation of the surface and pointing\naccuracies of the Ghana 32 m diameter radio astronomy telescope due to\nits structural deformation mainly influenced by gravity, wind and\nthermal loads.\n\n\n%0 Report\n%T The penumbral Moon\'s eclipse form 16 september 2016\n%A Rotaru, Adrian\n%A Pteancu, Mircea\n%A Zaharia, Cristian\n%+ AA(Bragadiru, Romania), AB(Private Astronomical Observatory, Arad, Romania), AC(Private Astronomical Observatory, Ploiesti, Romania)\n%B http://www.astronomy.ro/forum/viewtopic.php?p=159287#159287 (Comments in Romanian\n%D 2016\n%8 October 01, 2016\n%K THE MOON; ECLIPSES; PARTIAL; PENUMBRAL; ASTROPHOTOGRAPHY\n%U https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2016emo6.rept.....R\n%X The web page represents circumstances and photographs from the Moon\'s\npartial/penumbral eclipse from 16 September 2016 obtained from few\nvarious places in Romania (East Europe).

One could oversimplify NMR spectros-\ncopy by categorizing it into the two broad applications of structure\nelucidation of molecules (associated with chemistry and biology) and\nimaging (associated with medicine). But, this certainly does not do NMR\nspectroscopy justice in demonstrating its general acceptance and\nutilization across the sciences. This manuscript is not an effort to\npresent an exhaustive, or even partial review of NMR spectroscopy\napplications, but rather to provide a glimpse at the wide-ranging uses\nof NMR spectroscopy found within the confines of a single magnetic\nresonance research facility, the Stanford Magnetic Resonance Laboratory.\nIncluded here are summaries of projects involving protein structure\ndetermination, mapping of intermolecular interactions, exploring\nfundamental biological mechanisms, following compound cycling in the\nenvironmental, analysis of synthetic solid compounds, and microimaging\nof a model organism.\n%3 10.1007/978-90-481-2368-1_5\n\n\n%0 Conference Paper\n%T Time Domain Exploration with the Palomar-QUEST Sky Survey\n%A Mahabal, Ashish A.\n%A Drake, A.

As four photometric bandpasses are\nutilized in nearly simultaneously, PQ is well suited to search for\ntransient and highly variable objects. Using a series of software\nfilters i.e. programs to select/deselect objects based on certain\ncriteria we shorten the list of candidates from the initially flagged\ncandidate transients. Such filters include looking for known asteroids,\nknown variables, as well as moving, but previously uncatalogued objects\nbased on their motion within a scan as well as between successive scans.\nSome software filters also deal with instrumental artifacts, edge\neffects, and use clustering of spurious detections around bright stars.\nDuring a typical night when we cover about 500 sq. degrees, we detect\nhundreds of asteroids, the primary contaminants in the search for\nastrophysical transients beyond our solar system. Here we describe some\nstatistics based on the software filters we employ and the nature of the\nobjects that seem to survive the process. We also discuss the usefulness\nof this to amateur astronomers, projects like VOEventNet, and other\nsynoptic sky surveys. We also present an outline of the work we have\nstarted on quantifying the variability of quasars, blazars, as well as\nvarious classes of Galactic sources, by combining the large number of PQ\nscans with other existing data sources federated in the Virtual\nObservatory environment. The PQ survey is partially supported by the\nU.S. National Science Foundation (NSF).\n\n\n%0 Journal Article\n%T Analysis of Thermal Losses in the Flat-Plate Collector of a Thermosyphon Solar Water Heater\n%A ., S.

The lens antenna is made of an\nartificial material of metal particle. Comparing with our previous\nstudy, Anti-reflection (AR) layers are supplemented to the lens in this\nstudy to obtain a wave matching on the air-lens interface. The improved\nlens is in a disk shape of 50 mm diameter and 5.9 mm thickness. The lens\nis applied in a free-space setup, in which it is set in front of a patch\nantenna resonating at 15 GHz to get a high gain. The free-space setup is\nused to measure microwave attenuation and phase shift through a sawdust\nsample. The experimental results show that the multiple-reflection in\nthe free-space method becomes small, because the reflection on air-lens\ninterface has been reduced. The proposed AR lens antenna is flat and\nvery small in the size. It is possible to construct a very compact and\nlow cost free-space setup using the improved lens.\nDO  - 10.1007/s11220-017-0166-7\nER  -  \n\n\nTY  - Report\nT1  - Possible Overlaps Between Blobs, Grism Apertures, and Dithers\nA1  - Ryan, R.

Each aperture was designed to place the science target (e.g. a\nspecific star) on a cosmetically clean area of the IR detector.\nSimilarly, the dither patterns were designed to mitigate cosmetic\ndefects by rarely (or ideally never) placing such targets on known\ndefects. Because blobs accumulate with time, the originally defined\napertures and dither patterns may no longer accomplish their goals, it\nis important to reverify these combinations. We find two potential\noverlaps between the blob, aperture, and dither combinations, but do not\nrecommend any changes to the current suite of aperture references\npositions and/or dither patterns for two reasons. First, one of the\noverlaps occurs with a dither/aperture combination that is seldom used\nfor high-value science operations, but rather more common for wide-field\nsurveys/mosaics. Second, the other overlap is 8.7 pix from a blob that\nhas a fiducial radius of 10 pix, which already represents a very\nconservative distance. We conclude that a similar analysis should be\nrepeated as new blobs occur, to continue to ensure ideal operations for\nhigh-value science targets. The purpose of this report is to document\nthe analysis in order to facilitate its repetition in the future.\nER  -  \n\n\nTY  - Thesis/Dissertation\nT1  - Resolving Gas-Phase Metallicity In Galaxies\nA1  - Carton, David\nJO  - Ph.D. Thesis\nY1  - 2017/06/1\nKW  - galaxies: evolution/ galaxies: abundances/ galaxies: ISM\nUR  - https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017PhDT........14C\nN2  - Chapter 2: As part of the Bluedisk survey we analyse the radial gas-\nphase metallicity profiles of 50 late-type galaxies. We compare the\nmetallicity profiles of a sample of HI-rich galaxies against a control\nsample of HI-\'normal\' galaxies. We find the metallicity gradient of a\ngalaxy to be strongly correlated with its HI mass fraction {M}{HI}) /\n{M}_{\\ast}). We note that some galaxies exhibit a steeper metallicity\nprofile in the outer disc than in the inner disc. These galaxies are\nfound in both the HI-rich and control samples. This contradicts a\nprevious indication that these outer drops are exclusive to HI-rich\ngalaxies. These effects are not driven by bars, although we do find some\nindication that barred galaxies have flatter metallicity profiles. By\napplying a simple analytical model we are able to account for the\nvariety of metallicity profiles that the two samples present. The\nsuccess of this model implies that the metallicity in these isolated\ngalaxies may be in a local equilibrium, regulated by star formation.\nThis insight could provide an explanation of the observed local mass-\nmetallicity relation. Chapter 3 We present a method to recover the gas-\nphase metallicity gradients from integral field spectroscopic (IFS)\nobservations of barely resolved galaxies. We take a forward modelling\napproach and compare our models to the observed spatial distribution of\nemission line fluxes, accounting for the degrading effects of seeing and\nspatial binning. The method is flexible and is not limited to particular\nemission lines or instruments. We test the model through comparison to\nsynthetic observations and use downgraded observations of nearby\ngalaxies to validate this work. As a proof of concept we also apply the\nmodel to real IFS observations of high-redshift galaxies. From our\ntesting we show that the inferred metallicity gradients and central\nmetallicities are fairly insensitive to the assumptions made in the\nmodel and that they are reliably recovered for galaxies with sizes\napproximately equal to the half width at half maximum of the point-\nspread function. However, we also find that the presence of star forming\nclumps can significantly complicate the interpretation of metallicity\ngradients in moderately resolved high-redshift galaxies. Therefore we\nemphasize that care should be taken when comparing nearby well-resolved\nobservations to high-redshift observations of partially resolved\ngalaxies. Chapter 4 We present gas-phase metallicity gradients for 94\nstar-forming galaxies between (0.08 < z < 0.84). We find a negative\nmedian metallicity gradient of (-0.043^{+0.009}_{-0.007},\ndex/kpc)/span>, i.e. on average we find the centres of these galaxies to\nbe more metal-rich than their outskirts. However, there is significant\nscatter underlying this and we find that 10% (9) galaxies have\nsignificantly positive metallicity gradients, 39% (37) have\nsignificantly negative gradients, 28% (26) have gradients consistent\nwith being flat, the remainder 23% (22) are considered to have\nunreliable gradient estimates. We find a slight trend for a more\nnegative metallicity gradient with both increasing stellar mass and\nincreasing star formation rate (SFR). However, given the potential\nredshift and size selection effects, we do not consider these trends to\nbe significant. Indeed when we normalize the SFR of our galaxies\nrelative to the main sequence, we do not observe any trend between the\nmetallicity gradient and the normalized SFR. This finding is contrary to\nother recent studies of galaxies at similar and higher redshifts. We do,\nhowever, identify a novel trend between the metallicity gradient of a\ngalaxy and its size. Small galaxies ((r_d < 3 kpc)) present a large\nspread in observed metallicity gradients (both negative and positive\ngradients). In contrast, we find no large galaxies (r_d > 3 kpc) with\npositive metallicity gradients, and overall there is less scatter in the\nmetallicity gradient amongst the large galaxies. We suggest that these\nlarge (well-evolved) galaxies may be analogues of galaxies in the\npresent-day Universe, which also present a common negative metallicity\ngradient. Chapter 5 The relationship between a galaxy\'s stellar mass and\nits gas-phase metallicity results from the complex interplay between\nstar formation and the inflow and outflow of gas. Since the gradient of\nmetals in galaxies is also influenced by the same processes, it is\ntherefore natural to contrast the metallicity gradient with the mass-\nmetallicity relation. Here we study the interrelation of the stellar\nmass, central metallicity and metallicity gradient, using a sample of 72\ngalaxies spanning (0.13 < z < 0.84) with reliable metallicity gradient\nestimates. We find that typically the galaxies that fall below the mean\nmass-metallicity relation have flat or inverted metallicity gradients.\nWe quantify their relationship taking full account of the covariance\nbetween the different variables and find that at fixed mass the central\nmetallicity is anti-correlated with the metallicity gradient. We argue\nthat this is consistent with a scenario that suppresses the central\nmetallicity either through the inflow of metal poor gas or outflow of\nmetal enriched gas.\nDO  - 10.5281/zenodo.581221\nER  -  \n\n\nTY  - Miscellaneous\nT1  - sick: Spectroscopic inference crank\nA1  - Casey, Andrew R.\nJO  - Astrophysics Source Code Library\nY1  - 2017/06/1\nSP  - ascl:1706.009\nKW  - Software\nUR  - https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017ascl.soft06009C\nN2  - sick infers astrophysical parameters from noisy observed spectra.\nPhenomena that can alter the data (e.g., redshift, continuum,\ninstrumental broadening, outlier pixels) are modeled and simultaneously\ninferred with the astrophysical parameters of interest.

Tycho is a Type Ia supernova thought to be caused by\nthe thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf in a binary system that was\ndestabilized by mass transfer from its companion.After 450 years of\nexpansion, the remnant now has the morphological appearance of a roughly\ncircular cloud of clumpy ejecta. The forward shock wave from the\nsupernova, however, is known to have twice the velocity on one side of\nthe shell as on the other.To better understand this asymmetry, Williams\nand collaborators selected a total of 57 knots in Tychos ejecta, spread\nout around the remnant. They then used 12 years of Chandra X-ray\nobservations to measure both the knots proper motion in the plane of the\nsky and their line-of-sight velocity. These two measurements were then\ncombined to build a full 3D map of the motion of the ejecta.3D\nhydrodynamical simulations of Tycho, stopped at the current epoch. These\nshow that both initially smooth (top) and initially clumpy (bottom)\nejecta models are consistent with the current observations of the\nmorphology and dynamics of Tychos ejecta. [Adapted from Williams et al.\n2017]Symmetry and ClumpsWilliams and collaborators found that the knots\nhave total velocities that range from 2400 to 6600 km/s. Unlike the\nforward shock of the supernova, Tychos ejecta display no asymmetries in\ntheir motion which suggests that the explosion itself was symmetric. The\nmore likely explanation is a density gradient in the interstellar\nmedium, which could slow the shock wave on one side of the remnant\nwithout yet affecting the motion of the clumps of ejecta.As a final\nexploration, the authors attempt to address the origin of Tychos\nclumpiness. The fact that some of Tychos ejecta knots precede its outer\nedge has raised the question of whether the ejecta started out clumpy,\nor if they began smooth and only clumped during expansion. Williams and\ncollaborators matched the morphological and dynamical data to\nsimulations, demonstrating that neither scenario can be ruled out at\nthis time.This first 3D map of a Type Ia supernova represents an\nimportant step in our ability to understand these stellar explosions.\nThe authors suggest that well be able to expand on this map in the\nfuture with additional observations from Chandra, as well as with new\ndata from future X-ray observatories that will be able to detect fainter\nemission.CitationBrian J.

Spectroscopy on a cadence of a week or two is\nrequested to monitor changes in the disk outflow. Investigator Adrian\nLucy writes: "Adrian Lucy and Dr. Jeno Sokoloski (Columbia University)\nhave requested spectroscopic monitoring of the broad-absorption-line\nsymbiotic star V694 Mon (MWC 560), as a follow-up to coordinated multi-\nwavelength observations obtained during its recent outburst (ATel #8653,\n#8832, #8957; #10281). This system is a perfect place in which to study\nthe relationship between an accretion disk and disk winds/jets, and a\nhigh-value target for which even low-resolution spectra can be\nextraordinarily useful...Optical brightening in MWC 560 tends to predict\nhigher-velocity absorption, but sometimes jumps in absorption velocity\nalso appear during optical quiescence (e.g., Iijima 2001, ASPCS, 242,\n187). If such a velocity jump occurs during photometric quiescence, it\nmay prompt radio observations to confirm and test the proposed outflow\norigin for recently-discovered flat-spectrum radio emission (Lucy et al.\nATel #10281)...Furthermore, volunteer spectroscopic monitoring of this\nsystem has proved useful in unpredictable ways. For example, \'amateur\'\nspectra obtained by Somogyi P\\u00c3\\u00a9ter in 2015 December\ndemonstrated that the velocity of absorption was very low only a month\nbefore an optical outburst peak prompted absorption troughs up to 3000\nkm/s, which constrains very well the timing of the changes to the\noutflow to a degree that would not have been otherwise possible. Any\nresolution can be useful. A wavelength range that can accommodate a\nblueshift of at least 140 angstroms (6000 km/s) from the rest\nwavelengths of H-alpha at 6562 angstroms and/or H-beta at 4861 angstroms\nis ideal, though spectra with a smaller range can still be useful.\nPhotometry could potentially still be useful, but will be supplementary\nto medium-cadence photometry being collected by the ANS collaboration."\n"Spectroscopy may be uploaded to the ARAS database\n(http://www.astrosurf.com/aras/Aras_DataBase/DataBase.htm), or sent to\nAdrian and Jeno directly at <lucy@astro.columbia.edu>.

In early 2017, using archival\nWISE data, we discovered that its 3.4 and 4.6um fluxes have been\nsteadily rising since 2013, increased by a factor of 3.5 and 2.6\nrespectively. The last epoch data from WISE on 2016-12-12 shows that\nF01004-2237 has reached 7.5 and 14mJy at 3.4 and 4.6um. We interpret the\nmid-IR LCs as infrared echoes from the earlier optical flare. We infer a\nconvex, dust ring with a radius of 1 pc from the central heating source.\nOur model predicts that if this event is indeed a TDE, its mid-IR LCs\nshould start to fade in next 5-12 months because it has already\nreprocessed most of the UV/optical energy from the tidal disruption.\nHowever, if this event is due to activities from an AGN, its mid-IR LCs\ncould last over a much longer time scale. We request a total of 3.2\nhours of Spitzer time to monitor the mid-IR variations in next 12\nmonths. This will provide the critical data to confirm the nature of\nthis transient event.\nER  -  \n\n\nTY  - Thesis/Dissertation\nT1  - Surface Accuracy and Pointing Error Prediction of a 32 m Diameter Class Radio Astronomy Telescope\nA1  - Azankpo, Severin\nJO  - Masters Thesis\nY1  - 2017/03/1\nSP  - 2\nUR  - https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017MsT..........2A\nN2  - The African Very-long-baseline interferometry Network (AVN) is a joint\nproject between South Africa and eight partner African countries aimed\nat establishing a VLBI (Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry) capable\nnetwork of radio telescopes across the African continent. An existing\nstructure that is earmarked for this project, is a 32 m diameter antenna\nlocated in Ghana that has become obsolete due to advances in\ntelecommunication. The first phase of the conversion of this Ghana\nantenna into a radio astronomy telescope is to upgrade the antenna to\nobserve at 5 GHz to 6.7 GHz frequency and then later to 18 GHz within a\nrequired performing tolerance. The surface and pointing accuracies for a\nradio telescope are much more stringent than that of a telecommunication\nantenna. The mechanical pointing accuracy of such telescopes is\ninfluenced by factors such as mechanical alignment, structural\ndeformation, and servo drive train errors. The current research\ninvestigates the numerical simulation of the surface and pointing\naccuracies of the Ghana 32 m diameter radio astronomy telescope due to\nits structural deformation mainly influenced by gravity, wind and\nthermal loads.\nER  -  \n\n\nTY  - Report\nT1  - The penumbral Moon\'s eclipse form 16 september 2016\nA1  - Rotaru, Adrian\nA1  - Pteancu, Mircea\nA1  - Zaharia, Cristian\nJO  - http://www.astronomy.ro/forum/viewtopic.php?p=159287#159287 (Comments in Romanian\nY1  - 2016/10/1\nKW  - THE MOON/ ECLIPSES/ PARTIAL/ PENUMBRAL/ ASTROPHOTOGRAPHY\nUR  - https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2016emo6.rept.....R\nN2  - The web page represents circumstances and photographs from the Moon\'s\npartial/penumbral eclipse from 16 September 2016 obtained from few\nvarious places in Romania (East Europe).

One could oversimplify NMR spectros-\ncopy by categorizing it into the two broad applications of structure\nelucidation of molecules (associated with chemistry and biology) and\nimaging (associated with medicine). But, this certainly does not do NMR\nspectroscopy justice in demonstrating its general acceptance and\nutilization across the sciences. This manuscript is not an effort to\npresent an exhaustive, or even partial review of NMR spectroscopy\napplications, but rather to provide a glimpse at the wide-ranging uses\nof NMR spectroscopy found within the confines of a single magnetic\nresonance research facility, the Stanford Magnetic Resonance Laboratory.\nIncluded here are summaries of projects involving protein structure\ndetermination, mapping of intermolecular interactions, exploring\nfundamental biological mechanisms, following compound cycling in the\nenvironmental, analysis of synthetic solid compounds, and microimaging\nof a model organism.\nDO  - 10.1007/978-90-481-2368-1_5\nER  -  \n\n\nTY  - Conference\nT1  - Time Domain Exploration with the Palomar-QUEST Sky Survey\nA1  - Mahabal, Ashish A.\nA1  - Drake, A.

As four photometric bandpasses are\nutilized in nearly simultaneously, PQ is well suited to search for\ntransient and highly variable objects. Using a series of software\nfilters i.e. programs to select/deselect objects based on certain\ncriteria we shorten the list of candidates from the initially flagged\ncandidate transients. Such filters include looking for known asteroids,\nknown variables, as well as moving, but previously uncatalogued objects\nbased on their motion within a scan as well as between successive scans.\nSome software filters also deal with instrumental artifacts, edge\neffects, and use clustering of spurious detections around bright stars.\nDuring a typical night when we cover about 500 sq. degrees, we detect\nhundreds of asteroids, the primary contaminants in the search for\nastrophysical transients beyond our solar system. Here we describe some\nstatistics based on the software filters we employ and the nature of the\nobjects that seem to survive the process. We also discuss the usefulness\nof this to amateur astronomers, projects like VOEventNet, and other\nsynoptic sky surveys. We also present an outline of the work we have\nstarted on quantifying the variability of quasars, blazars, as well as\nvarious classes of Galactic sources, by combining the large number of PQ\nscans with other existing data sources federated in the Virtual\nObservatory environment.

Technical requirements for different mission trajectories and\norbits are addressed with consideration given to the various tradeoffs\nwhich may need to be considered. The broad spectrum of spacecraft are\nconsidered with emphasis upon those of greater military significance\n(i.e., near earth orbiting satellites). Technical requirements include,\nbut are not limited to, accuracy; physical characteristics such as\nweight and volume; support requirements such as electrical power and\nground support; and system integrity. Generic navigation suites for\nspacecraft applications are described. It is shown that operational\nspacecraft rely primarily upon ground-based tracking and computational\ncenters with little or no navigational function allocated to the\nvehicle, while technology development efforts have been and continue to\nbe directed primarily toward onboard navigation suites. The military\nsignificance of onboard navigators is shown to both improve spacecraft\nsurvivability and performance (accuracy).\nER  -  \n\n\nTY  - Book, Whole\nT1  - Applied nonlinear dynamics: analytical, computational and experimental methods\nA1  - Nayfeh, Ali H.\nA1  - Balachandran, Balakumar\nJO  - Wiley series in nonlinear science\nY1  - 1995/01/1\nUR  - https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/1995anda.book.....N\nER  -  \n\n\nTY  - Journal\nT1  - Autonomous navigation using lunar beacons\nA1  - Khatib, A.

The\nblack box processor would perform on-board computation with one-way\nDoppler/range data and dynamical models. Alternatively, GEO satellites\nsuch as the GPS or TDRSS spacecraft can be used with interferometric\ntechniques to provide decimeter-level accuracy for aircraft navigation.\nER  -  \n\n\n'}

The lens antenna is made of an\nartificial material of metal particle. Comparing with our previous\nstudy, Anti-reflection (AR) layers are supplemented to the lens in this\nstudy to obtain a wave matching on the air-lens interface. The improved\nlens is in a disk shape of 50 mm diameter and 5.9 mm thickness. The lens\nis applied in a free-space setup, in which it is set in front of a patch\nantenna resonating at 15 GHz to get a high gain. The free-space setup is\nused to measure microwave attenuation and phase shift through a sawdust\nsample. The experimental results show that the multiple-reflection in\nthe free-space method becomes small, because the reflection on air-lens\ninterface has been reduced. The proposed AR lens antenna is flat and\nvery small in the size. It is possible to construct a very compact and\nlow cost free-space setup using the improved lens.\nDO  - 10.1007/s11220-017-0166-7\nER  -  \n\n\nTY  - RPRT\nT1  - Possible Overlaps Between Blobs, Grism Apertures, and Dithers\nA1  - Ryan, R.

Each aperture was designed to place the science target (e.g. a\nspecific star) on a cosmetically clean area of the IR detector.\nSimilarly, the dither patterns were designed to mitigate cosmetic\ndefects by rarely (or ideally never) placing such targets on known\ndefects. Because blobs accumulate with time, the originally defined\napertures and dither patterns may no longer accomplish their goals, it\nis important to reverify these combinations. We find two potential\noverlaps between the blob, aperture, and dither combinations, but do not\nrecommend any changes to the current suite of aperture references\npositions and/or dither patterns for two reasons. First, one of the\noverlaps occurs with a dither/aperture combination that is seldom used\nfor high-value science operations, but rather more common for wide-field\nsurveys/mosaics. Second, the other overlap is 8.7 pix from a blob that\nhas a fiducial radius of 10 pix, which already represents a very\nconservative distance. We conclude that a similar analysis should be\nrepeated as new blobs occur, to continue to ensure ideal operations for\nhigh-value science targets. The purpose of this report is to document\nthe analysis in order to facilitate its repetition in the future.\nER  -  \n\n\nTY  - Thesis/Dissertation\nT1  - Resolving Gas-Phase Metallicity In Galaxies\nA1  - Carton, David\nJO  - Ph.D. Thesis\nY1  - 2017/06/1\nKW  - galaxies: evolution\nKW  - galaxies: abundances\nKW  - galaxies: ISM\nUR  - https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017PhDT........14C\nN2  - Chapter 2: As part of the Bluedisk survey we analyse the radial gas-\nphase metallicity profiles of 50 late-type galaxies. We compare the\nmetallicity profiles of a sample of HI-rich galaxies against a control\nsample of HI-\'normal\' galaxies. We find the metallicity gradient of a\ngalaxy to be strongly correlated with its HI mass fraction {M}{HI}) /\n{M}_{\\ast}). We note that some galaxies exhibit a steeper metallicity\nprofile in the outer disc than in the inner disc. These galaxies are\nfound in both the HI-rich and control samples. This contradicts a\nprevious indication that these outer drops are exclusive to HI-rich\ngalaxies. These effects are not driven by bars, although we do find some\nindication that barred galaxies have flatter metallicity profiles. By\napplying a simple analytical model we are able to account for the\nvariety of metallicity profiles that the two samples present. The\nsuccess of this model implies that the metallicity in these isolated\ngalaxies may be in a local equilibrium, regulated by star formation.\nThis insight could provide an explanation of the observed local mass-\nmetallicity relation. Chapter 3 We present a method to recover the gas-\nphase metallicity gradients from integral field spectroscopic (IFS)\nobservations of barely resolved galaxies. We take a forward modelling\napproach and compare our models to the observed spatial distribution of\nemission line fluxes, accounting for the degrading effects of seeing and\nspatial binning. The method is flexible and is not limited to particular\nemission lines or instruments. We test the model through comparison to\nsynthetic observations and use downgraded observations of nearby\ngalaxies to validate this work. As a proof of concept we also apply the\nmodel to real IFS observations of high-redshift galaxies. From our\ntesting we show that the inferred metallicity gradients and central\nmetallicities are fairly insensitive to the assumptions made in the\nmodel and that they are reliably recovered for galaxies with sizes\napproximately equal to the half width at half maximum of the point-\nspread function. However, we also find that the presence of star forming\nclumps can significantly complicate the interpretation of metallicity\ngradients in moderately resolved high-redshift galaxies. Therefore we\nemphasize that care should be taken when comparing nearby well-resolved\nobservations to high-redshift observations of partially resolved\ngalaxies. Chapter 4 We present gas-phase metallicity gradients for 94\nstar-forming galaxies between (0.08 < z < 0.84). We find a negative\nmedian metallicity gradient of (-0.043^{+0.009}_{-0.007},\ndex/kpc)/span>, i.e. on average we find the centres of these galaxies to\nbe more metal-rich than their outskirts. However, there is significant\nscatter underlying this and we find that 10% (9) galaxies have\nsignificantly positive metallicity gradients, 39% (37) have\nsignificantly negative gradients, 28% (26) have gradients consistent\nwith being flat, the remainder 23% (22) are considered to have\nunreliable gradient estimates. We find a slight trend for a more\nnegative metallicity gradient with both increasing stellar mass and\nincreasing star formation rate (SFR). However, given the potential\nredshift and size selection effects, we do not consider these trends to\nbe significant. Indeed when we normalize the SFR of our galaxies\nrelative to the main sequence, we do not observe any trend between the\nmetallicity gradient and the normalized SFR. This finding is contrary to\nother recent studies of galaxies at similar and higher redshifts. We do,\nhowever, identify a novel trend between the metallicity gradient of a\ngalaxy and its size. Small galaxies ((r_d < 3 kpc)) present a large\nspread in observed metallicity gradients (both negative and positive\ngradients). In contrast, we find no large galaxies (r_d > 3 kpc) with\npositive metallicity gradients, and overall there is less scatter in the\nmetallicity gradient amongst the large galaxies. We suggest that these\nlarge (well-evolved) galaxies may be analogues of galaxies in the\npresent-day Universe, which also present a common negative metallicity\ngradient. Chapter 5 The relationship between a galaxy\'s stellar mass and\nits gas-phase metallicity results from the complex interplay between\nstar formation and the inflow and outflow of gas. Since the gradient of\nmetals in galaxies is also influenced by the same processes, it is\ntherefore natural to contrast the metallicity gradient with the mass-\nmetallicity relation. Here we study the interrelation of the stellar\nmass, central metallicity and metallicity gradient, using a sample of 72\ngalaxies spanning (0.13 < z < 0.84) with reliable metallicity gradient\nestimates. We find that typically the galaxies that fall below the mean\nmass-metallicity relation have flat or inverted metallicity gradients.\nWe quantify their relationship taking full account of the covariance\nbetween the different variables and find that at fixed mass the central\nmetallicity is anti-correlated with the metallicity gradient. We argue\nthat this is consistent with a scenario that suppresses the central\nmetallicity either through the inflow of metal poor gas or outflow of\nmetal enriched gas.\nDO  - 10.5281/zenodo.581221\nER  -  \n\n\nTY  - MISC\nT1  - sick: Spectroscopic inference crank\nA1  - Casey, Andrew R.\nJO  - Astrophysics Source Code Library\nY1  - 2017/06/1\nSP  - ascl:1706.009\nKW  - Software\nUR  - https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017ascl.soft06009C\nN2  - sick infers astrophysical parameters from noisy observed spectra.\nPhenomena that can alter the data (e.g., redshift, continuum,\ninstrumental broadening, outlier pixels) are modeled and simultaneously\ninferred with the astrophysical parameters of interest.

Magenta regions have redshifted line-of-sight\nvelocities (moving away from us); cyan regions have blueshifted light-\nof-sight velocities (moving toward us). [Williams et al. 2017]The Tycho\nsupernova remnant was first observed in the year 1572. Nearly 450 years\nlater, astronomers have now used X-ray observations of Tycho to build\nthe first-ever 3D map of a Type Ia supernova remnant.Signs of\nExplosionsSupernova remnants are spectacular structures formed by the\nejecta of stellar explosions as they expand outwards into the\nsurrounding interstellar medium.One peculiarity of these remnants is\nthat they often exhibit asymmetries in their appearance and motion. Is\nthis because the ejecta are expanding into a nonuniform interstellar\nmedium? Or was the explosion itself asymmetric? The best way we can\nexplore this question is with detailed observations of the\nremnants.Histograms of the velocity in distribution of the knots in the\nX (green), Y (blue) and Z (red) directions (+Z is away from the\nobserver). They show no evidence for asymmetric expansion of the knots.\n[Williams et al. 2017]Enter TychoTo this end, a team of scientists led\nby Brian Williams (Space Telescope Science Institute and NASA Goddard\nSFC) has worked to map out the 3D velocities of the ejecta in the Tycho\nsupernova remnant. Tycho is a Type Ia supernova thought to be caused by\nthe thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf in a binary system that was\ndestabilized by mass transfer from its companion.After 450 years of\nexpansion, the remnant now has the morphological appearance of a roughly\ncircular cloud of clumpy ejecta. The forward shock wave from the\nsupernova, however, is known to have twice the velocity on one side of\nthe shell as on the other.To better understand this asymmetry, Williams\nand collaborators selected a total of 57 knots in Tychos ejecta, spread\nout around the remnant. They then used 12 years of Chandra X-ray\nobservations to measure both the knots proper motion in the plane of the\nsky and their line-of-sight velocity. These two measurements were then\ncombined to build a full 3D map of the motion of the ejecta.3D\nhydrodynamical simulations of Tycho, stopped at the current epoch. These\nshow that both initially smooth (top) and initially clumpy (bottom)\nejecta models are consistent with the current observations of the\nmorphology and dynamics of Tychos ejecta. [Adapted from Williams et al.\n2017]Symmetry and ClumpsWilliams and collaborators found that the knots\nhave total velocities that range from 2400 to 6600 km/s. Unlike the\nforward shock of the supernova, Tychos ejecta display no asymmetries in\ntheir motion which suggests that the explosion itself was symmetric. The\nmore likely explanation is a density gradient in the interstellar\nmedium, which could slow the shock wave on one side of the remnant\nwithout yet affecting the motion of the clumps of ejecta.As a final\nexploration, the authors attempt to address the origin of Tychos\nclumpiness. The fact that some of Tychos ejecta knots precede its outer\nedge has raised the question of whether the ejecta started out clumpy,\nor if they began smooth and only clumped during expansion. Williams and\ncollaborators matched the morphological and dynamical data to\nsimulations, demonstrating that neither scenario can be ruled out at\nthis time.This first 3D map of a Type Ia supernova represents an\nimportant step in our ability to understand these stellar explosions.\nThe authors suggest that well be able to expand on this map in the\nfuture with additional observations from Chandra, as well as with new\ndata from future X-ray observatories that will be able to detect fainter\nemission.CitationBrian J.

Spectroscopy on a cadence of a week or two is\nrequested to monitor changes in the disk outflow. Investigator Adrian\nLucy writes: "Adrian Lucy and Dr. Jeno Sokoloski (Columbia University)\nhave requested spectroscopic monitoring of the broad-absorption-line\nsymbiotic star V694 Mon (MWC 560), as a follow-up to coordinated multi-\nwavelength observations obtained during its recent outburst (ATel #8653,\n#8832, #8957; #10281). This system is a perfect place in which to study\nthe relationship between an accretion disk and disk winds/jets, and a\nhigh-value target for which even low-resolution spectra can be\nextraordinarily useful...Optical brightening in MWC 560 tends to predict\nhigher-velocity absorption, but sometimes jumps in absorption velocity\nalso appear during optical quiescence (e.g., Iijima 2001, ASPCS, 242,\n187). If such a velocity jump occurs during photometric quiescence, it\nmay prompt radio observations to confirm and test the proposed outflow\norigin for recently-discovered flat-spectrum radio emission (Lucy et al.\nATel #10281)...Furthermore, volunteer spectroscopic monitoring of this\nsystem has proved useful in unpredictable ways. For example, \'amateur\'\nspectra obtained by Somogyi P\\u00c3\\u00a9ter in 2015 December\ndemonstrated that the velocity of absorption was very low only a month\nbefore an optical outburst peak prompted absorption troughs up to 3000\nkm/s, which constrains very well the timing of the changes to the\noutflow to a degree that would not have been otherwise possible. Any\nresolution can be useful. A wavelength range that can accommodate a\nblueshift of at least 140 angstroms (6000 km/s) from the rest\nwavelengths of H-alpha at 6562 angstroms and/or H-beta at 4861 angstroms\nis ideal, though spectra with a smaller range can still be useful.\nPhotometry could potentially still be useful, but will be supplementary\nto medium-cadence photometry being collected by the ANS collaboration."\n"Spectroscopy may be uploaded to the ARAS database\n(http://www.astrosurf.com/aras/Aras_DataBase/DataBase.htm), or sent to\nAdrian and Jeno directly at <lucy@astro.columbia.edu>.

In early 2017, using archival\nWISE data, we discovered that its 3.4 and 4.6um fluxes have been\nsteadily rising since 2013, increased by a factor of 3.5 and 2.6\nrespectively. The last epoch data from WISE on 2016-12-12 shows that\nF01004-2237 has reached 7.5 and 14mJy at 3.4 and 4.6um. We interpret the\nmid-IR LCs as infrared echoes from the earlier optical flare. We infer a\nconvex, dust ring with a radius of 1 pc from the central heating source.\nOur model predicts that if this event is indeed a TDE, its mid-IR LCs\nshould start to fade in next 5-12 months because it has already\nreprocessed most of the UV/optical energy from the tidal disruption.\nHowever, if this event is due to activities from an AGN, its mid-IR LCs\ncould last over a much longer time scale. We request a total of 3.2\nhours of Spitzer time to monitor the mid-IR variations in next 12\nmonths. This will provide the critical data to confirm the nature of\nthis transient event.\nER  -  \n\n\nTY  - Thesis/Dissertation\nT1  - Surface Accuracy and Pointing Error Prediction of a 32 m Diameter Class Radio Astronomy Telescope\nA1  - Azankpo, Severin\nJO  - Masters Thesis\nY1  - 2017/03/1\nSP  - 2\nUR  - https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017MsT..........2A\nN2  - The African Very-long-baseline interferometry Network (AVN) is a joint\nproject between South Africa and eight partner African countries aimed\nat establishing a VLBI (Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry) capable\nnetwork of radio telescopes across the African continent. An existing\nstructure that is earmarked for this project, is a 32 m diameter antenna\nlocated in Ghana that has become obsolete due to advances in\ntelecommunication. The first phase of the conversion of this Ghana\nantenna into a radio astronomy telescope is to upgrade the antenna to\nobserve at 5 GHz to 6.7 GHz frequency and then later to 18 GHz within a\nrequired performing tolerance. The surface and pointing accuracies for a\nradio telescope are much more stringent than that of a telecommunication\nantenna. The mechanical pointing accuracy of such telescopes is\ninfluenced by factors such as mechanical alignment, structural\ndeformation, and servo drive train errors. The current research\ninvestigates the numerical simulation of the surface and pointing\naccuracies of the Ghana 32 m diameter radio astronomy telescope due to\nits structural deformation mainly influenced by gravity, wind and\nthermal loads.\nER  -  \n\n\nTY  - RPRT\nT1  - The penumbral Moon\'s eclipse form 16 september 2016\nA1  - Rotaru, Adrian\nA1  - Pteancu, Mircea\nA1  - Zaharia, Cristian\nJO  - http://www.astronomy.ro/forum/viewtopic.php?p=159287#159287 (Comments in Romanian\nY1  - 2016/10/1\nKW  - THE MOON\nKW  - ECLIPSES\nKW  - PARTIAL\nKW  - PENUMBRAL\nKW  - ASTROPHOTOGRAPHY\nUR  - https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2016emo6.rept.....R\nN2  - The web page represents circumstances and photographs from the Moon\'s\npartial/penumbral eclipse from 16 September 2016 obtained from few\nvarious places in Romania (East Europe).

One could oversimplify NMR spectros-\ncopy by categorizing it into the two broad applications of structure\nelucidation of molecules (associated with chemistry and biology) and\nimaging (associated with medicine). But, this certainly does not do NMR\nspectroscopy justice in demonstrating its general acceptance and\nutilization across the sciences. This manuscript is not an effort to\npresent an exhaustive, or even partial review of NMR spectroscopy\napplications, but rather to provide a glimpse at the wide-ranging uses\nof NMR spectroscopy found within the confines of a single magnetic\nresonance research facility, the Stanford Magnetic Resonance Laboratory.\nIncluded here are summaries of projects involving protein structure\ndetermination, mapping of intermolecular interactions, exploring\nfundamental biological mechanisms, following compound cycling in the\nenvironmental, analysis of synthetic solid compounds, and microimaging\nof a model organism.\nDO  - 10.1007/978-90-481-2368-1_5\nER  -  \n\n\nTY  - CONF\nT1  - Time Domain Exploration with the Palomar-QUEST Sky Survey\nA1  - Mahabal, Ashish A.\nA1  - Drake, A.

As four photometric bandpasses are\nutilized in nearly simultaneously, PQ is well suited to search for\ntransient and highly variable objects. Using a series of software\nfilters i.e. programs to select/deselect objects based on certain\ncriteria we shorten the list of candidates from the initially flagged\ncandidate transients. Such filters include looking for known asteroids,\nknown variables, as well as moving, but previously uncatalogued objects\nbased on their motion within a scan as well as between successive scans.\nSome software filters also deal with instrumental artifacts, edge\neffects, and use clustering of spurious detections around bright stars.\nDuring a typical night when we cover about 500 sq. degrees, we detect\nhundreds of asteroids, the primary contaminants in the search for\nastrophysical transients beyond our solar system. Here we describe some\nstatistics based on the software filters we employ and the nature of the\nobjects that seem to survive the process. We also discuss the usefulness\nof this to amateur astronomers, projects like VOEventNet, and other\nsynoptic sky surveys. We also present an outline of the work we have\nstarted on quantifying the variability of quasars, blazars, as well as\nvarious classes of Galactic sources, by combining the large number of PQ\nscans with other existing data sources federated in the Virtual\nObservatory environment.

The broad spectrum of spacecraft are\nconsidered with emphasis upon those of greater military significance\n(i.e., near earth orbiting satellites). Technical requirements include,\nbut are not limited to, accuracy; physical characteristics such as\nweight and volume; support requirements such as electrical power and\nground support; and system integrity.

Two beacons could be soft-landed on the\nlunar surface at the limits of allowable separation and each would\ntransmit a wide-beam signal with cones reaching GEO heights and be\nstrong enough to be received by small antennae in near-earth orbit. The\nblack box processor would perform on-board computation with one-way\nDoppler/range data and dynamical models.

The lens antenna is made of an\nartificial material of metal particle. Comparing with our previous\nstudy, Anti-reflection (AR) layers are supplemented to the lens in this\nstudy to obtain a wave matching on the air-lens interface. The improved\nlens is in a disk shape of 50 mm diameter and 5.9 mm thickness. The lens\nis applied in a free-space setup, in which it is set in front of a patch\nantenna resonating at 15 GHz to get a high gain. The free-space setup is\nused to measure microwave attenuation and phase shift through a sawdust\nsample. The experimental results show that the multiple-reflection in\nthe free-space method becomes small, because the reflection on air-lens\ninterface has been reduced. The proposed AR lens antenna is flat and\nvery small in the size. It is possible to construct a very compact and\nlow cost free-space setup using the improved lens.\nDO DOI: 10.1007/s11220-017-0166-7\n\n\nRT Report\nT1 Possible Overlaps Between Blobs, Grism Apertures, and Dithers\nA1 Ryan, R.

Because blobs accumulate with time, the originally defined\napertures and dither patterns may no longer accomplish their goals, it\nis important to reverify these combinations. We find two potential\noverlaps between the blob, aperture, and dither combinations, but do not\nrecommend any changes to the current suite of aperture references\npositions and/or dither patterns for two reasons. First, one of the\noverlaps occurs with a dither/aperture combination that is seldom used\nfor high-value science operations, but rather more common for wide-field\nsurveys/mosaics. Second, the other overlap is 8.7 pix from a blob that\nhas a fiducial radius of 10 pix, which already represents a very\nconservative distance. We conclude that a similar analysis should be\nrepeated as new blobs occur, to continue to ensure ideal operations for\nhigh-value science targets. The purpose of this report is to document\nthe analysis in order to facilitate its repetition in the future.\n\n\nRT Thesis/Dissertation\nT1 Resolving Gas-Phase Metallicity In Galaxies\nA1 Carton, David\nAD AA(Leiden University)\nJF Ph.D. Thesis\nYR 2017\nFD 2017/06/1\nK1 galaxies: evolution\nK1 galaxies: abundances\nK1 galaxies: ISM\nLK https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017PhDT........14C\nAB Chapter 2: As part of the Bluedisk survey we analyse the radial gas-\nphase metallicity profiles of 50 late-type galaxies. We compare the\nmetallicity profiles of a sample of HI-rich galaxies against a control\nsample of HI-\'normal\' galaxies. We find the metallicity gradient of a\ngalaxy to be strongly correlated with its HI mass fraction {M}{HI}) /\n{M}_{\\ast}). We note that some galaxies exhibit a steeper metallicity\nprofile in the outer disc than in the inner disc. These galaxies are\nfound in both the HI-rich and control samples. This contradicts a\nprevious indication that these outer drops are exclusive to HI-rich\ngalaxies. These effects are not driven by bars, although we do find some\nindication that barred galaxies have flatter metallicity profiles. By\napplying a simple analytical model we are able to account for the\nvariety of metallicity profiles that the two samples present. The\nsuccess of this model implies that the metallicity in these isolated\ngalaxies may be in a local equilibrium, regulated by star formation.\nThis insight could provide an explanation of the observed local mass-\nmetallicity relation. Chapter 3 We present a method to recover the gas-\nphase metallicity gradients from integral field spectroscopic (IFS)\nobservations of barely resolved galaxies. We take a forward modelling\napproach and compare our models to the observed spatial distribution of\nemission line fluxes, accounting for the degrading effects of seeing and\nspatial binning. The method is flexible and is not limited to particular\nemission lines or instruments. We test the model through comparison to\nsynthetic observations and use downgraded observations of nearby\ngalaxies to validate this work. As a proof of concept we also apply the\nmodel to real IFS observations of high-redshift galaxies. From our\ntesting we show that the inferred metallicity gradients and central\nmetallicities are fairly insensitive to the assumptions made in the\nmodel and that they are reliably recovered for galaxies with sizes\napproximately equal to the half width at half maximum of the point-\nspread function. However, we also find that the presence of star forming\nclumps can significantly complicate the interpretation of metallicity\ngradients in moderately resolved high-redshift galaxies. Therefore we\nemphasize that care should be taken when comparing nearby well-resolved\nobservations to high-redshift observations of partially resolved\ngalaxies. Chapter 4 We present gas-phase metallicity gradients for 94\nstar-forming galaxies between (0.08 < z < 0.84). We find a negative\nmedian metallicity gradient of (-0.043^{+0.009}_{-0.007},\ndex/kpc)/span>, i.e. on average we find the centres of these galaxies to\nbe more metal-rich than their outskirts. However, there is significant\nscatter underlying this and we find that 10% (9) galaxies have\nsignificantly positive metallicity gradients, 39% (37) have\nsignificantly negative gradients, 28% (26) have gradients consistent\nwith being flat, the remainder 23% (22) are considered to have\nunreliable gradient estimates. We find a slight trend for a more\nnegative metallicity gradient with both increasing stellar mass and\nincreasing star formation rate (SFR). However, given the potential\nredshift and size selection effects, we do not consider these trends to\nbe significant. Indeed when we normalize the SFR of our galaxies\nrelative to the main sequence, we do not observe any trend between the\nmetallicity gradient and the normalized SFR. This finding is contrary to\nother recent studies of galaxies at similar and higher redshifts. We do,\nhowever, identify a novel trend between the metallicity gradient of a\ngalaxy and its size. Small galaxies ((r_d < 3 kpc)) present a large\nspread in observed metallicity gradients (both negative and positive\ngradients). In contrast, we find no large galaxies (r_d > 3 kpc) with\npositive metallicity gradients, and overall there is less scatter in the\nmetallicity gradient amongst the large galaxies. We suggest that these\nlarge (well-evolved) galaxies may be analogues of galaxies in the\npresent-day Universe, which also present a common negative metallicity\ngradient. Chapter 5 The relationship between a galaxy\'s stellar mass and\nits gas-phase metallicity results from the complex interplay between\nstar formation and the inflow and outflow of gas. Since the gradient of\nmetals in galaxies is also influenced by the same processes, it is\ntherefore natural to contrast the metallicity gradient with the mass-\nmetallicity relation. Here we study the interrelation of the stellar\nmass, central metallicity and metallicity gradient, using a sample of 72\ngalaxies spanning (0.13 < z < 0.84) with reliable metallicity gradient\nestimates. We find that typically the galaxies that fall below the mean\nmass-metallicity relation have flat or inverted metallicity gradients.\nWe quantify their relationship taking full account of the covariance\nbetween the different variables and find that at fixed mass the central\nmetallicity is anti-correlated with the metallicity gradient. We argue\nthat this is consistent with a scenario that suppresses the central\nmetallicity either through the inflow of metal poor gas or outflow of\nmetal enriched gas.\nDO DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.581221\n\n\nRT Generic\nT1 sick: Spectroscopic inference crank\nA1 Casey, Andrew R.\nAD AA(-)\nJF Astrophysics Source Code Library\nYR 2017\nFD 2017/06/1\nSP ascl:1706.009\nK1 Software\nLK https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017ascl.soft06009C\nAB sick infers astrophysical parameters from noisy observed spectra.\nPhenomena that can alter the data (e.g., redshift, continuum,\ninstrumental broadening, outlier pixels) are modeled and simultaneously\ninferred with the astrophysical parameters of interest.

Magenta regions have redshifted line-of-sight\nvelocities (moving away from us); cyan regions have blueshifted light-\nof-sight velocities (moving toward us). [Williams et al. 2017]The Tycho\nsupernova remnant was first observed in the year 1572. Nearly 450 years\nlater, astronomers have now used X-ray observations of Tycho to build\nthe first-ever 3D map of a Type Ia supernova remnant.Signs of\nExplosionsSupernova remnants are spectacular structures formed by the\nejecta of stellar explosions as they expand outwards into the\nsurrounding interstellar medium.One peculiarity of these remnants is\nthat they often exhibit asymmetries in their appearance and motion. Is\nthis because the ejecta are expanding into a nonuniform interstellar\nmedium? Or was the explosion itself asymmetric? The best way we can\nexplore this question is with detailed observations of the\nremnants.Histograms of the velocity in distribution of the knots in the\nX (green), Y (blue) and Z (red) directions (+Z is away from the\nobserver). They show no evidence for asymmetric expansion of the knots.\n[Williams et al. 2017]Enter TychoTo this end, a team of scientists led\nby Brian Williams (Space Telescope Science Institute and NASA Goddard\nSFC) has worked to map out the 3D velocities of the ejecta in the Tycho\nsupernova remnant. Tycho is a Type Ia supernova thought to be caused by\nthe thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf in a binary system that was\ndestabilized by mass transfer from its companion.After 450 years of\nexpansion, the remnant now has the morphological appearance of a roughly\ncircular cloud of clumpy ejecta. The forward shock wave from the\nsupernova, however, is known to have twice the velocity on one side of\nthe shell as on the other.To better understand this asymmetry, Williams\nand collaborators selected a total of 57 knots in Tychos ejecta, spread\nout around the remnant. They then used 12 years of Chandra X-ray\nobservations to measure both the knots proper motion in the plane of the\nsky and their line-of-sight velocity. These two measurements were then\ncombined to build a full 3D map of the motion of the ejecta.3D\nhydrodynamical simulations of Tycho, stopped at the current epoch. These\nshow that both initially smooth (top) and initially clumpy (bottom)\nejecta models are consistent with the current observations of the\nmorphology and dynamics of Tychos ejecta. [Adapted from Williams et al.\n2017]Symmetry and ClumpsWilliams and collaborators found that the knots\nhave total velocities that range from 2400 to 6600 km/s. Unlike the\nforward shock of the supernova, Tychos ejecta display no asymmetries in\ntheir motion which suggests that the explosion itself was symmetric. The\nmore likely explanation is a density gradient in the interstellar\nmedium, which could slow the shock wave on one side of the remnant\nwithout yet affecting the motion of the clumps of ejecta.As a final\nexploration, the authors attempt to address the origin of Tychos\nclumpiness. The fact that some of Tychos ejecta knots precede its outer\nedge has raised the question of whether the ejecta started out clumpy,\nor if they began smooth and only clumped during expansion. Williams and\ncollaborators matched the morphological and dynamical data to\nsimulations, demonstrating that neither scenario can be ruled out at\nthis time.This first 3D map of a Type Ia supernova represents an\nimportant step in our ability to understand these stellar explosions.\nThe authors suggest that well be able to expand on this map in the\nfuture with additional observations from Chandra, as well as with new\ndata from future X-ray observatories that will be able to detect fainter\nemission.CitationBrian J.

Spectroscopy on a cadence of a week or two is\nrequested to monitor changes in the disk outflow. Investigator Adrian\nLucy writes: "Adrian Lucy and Dr. Jeno Sokoloski (Columbia University)\nhave requested spectroscopic monitoring of the broad-absorption-line\nsymbiotic star V694 Mon (MWC 560), as a follow-up to coordinated multi-\nwavelength observations obtained during its recent outburst (ATel #8653,\n#8832, #8957; #10281). This system is a perfect place in which to study\nthe relationship between an accretion disk and disk winds/jets, and a\nhigh-value target for which even low-resolution spectra can be\nextraordinarily useful...Optical brightening in MWC 560 tends to predict\nhigher-velocity absorption, but sometimes jumps in absorption velocity\nalso appear during optical quiescence (e.g., Iijima 2001, ASPCS, 242,\n187). If such a velocity jump occurs during photometric quiescence, it\nmay prompt radio observations to confirm and test the proposed outflow\norigin for recently-discovered flat-spectrum radio emission (Lucy et al.\nATel #10281)...Furthermore, volunteer spectroscopic monitoring of this\nsystem has proved useful in unpredictable ways. For example, \'amateur\'\nspectra obtained by Somogyi P\\u00c3\\u00a9ter in 2015 December\ndemonstrated that the velocity of absorption was very low only a month\nbefore an optical outburst peak prompted absorption troughs up to 3000\nkm/s, which constrains very well the timing of the changes to the\noutflow to a degree that would not have been otherwise possible. Any\nresolution can be useful. A wavelength range that can accommodate a\nblueshift of at least 140 angstroms (6000 km/s) from the rest\nwavelengths of H-alpha at 6562 angstroms and/or H-beta at 4861 angstroms\nis ideal, though spectra with a smaller range can still be useful.\nPhotometry could potentially still be useful, but will be supplementary\nto medium-cadence photometry being collected by the ANS collaboration."\n"Spectroscopy may be uploaded to the ARAS database\n(http://www.astrosurf.com/aras/Aras_DataBase/DataBase.htm), or sent to\nAdrian and Jeno directly at <lucy@astro.columbia.edu>.

In early 2017, using archival\nWISE data, we discovered that its 3.4 and 4.6um fluxes have been\nsteadily rising since 2013, increased by a factor of 3.5 and 2.6\nrespectively. The last epoch data from WISE on 2016-12-12 shows that\nF01004-2237 has reached 7.5 and 14mJy at 3.4 and 4.6um. We interpret the\nmid-IR LCs as infrared echoes from the earlier optical flare. We infer a\nconvex, dust ring with a radius of 1 pc from the central heating source.\nOur model predicts that if this event is indeed a TDE, its mid-IR LCs\nshould start to fade in next 5-12 months because it has already\nreprocessed most of the UV/optical energy from the tidal disruption.\nHowever, if this event is due to activities from an AGN, its mid-IR LCs\ncould last over a much longer time scale. We request a total of 3.2\nhours of Spitzer time to monitor the mid-IR variations in next 12\nmonths.

An existing\nstructure that is earmarked for this project, is a 32 m diameter antenna\nlocated in Ghana that has become obsolete due to advances in\ntelecommunication. The first phase of the conversion of this Ghana\nantenna into a radio astronomy telescope is to upgrade the antenna to\nobserve at 5 GHz to 6.7 GHz frequency and then later to 18 GHz within a\nrequired performing tolerance. The surface and pointing accuracies for a\nradio telescope are much more stringent than that of a telecommunication\nantenna.

As four photometric bandpasses are\nutilized in nearly simultaneously, PQ is well suited to search for\ntransient and highly variable objects. Using a series of software\nfilters i.e. programs to select/deselect objects based on certain\ncriteria we shorten the list of candidates from the initially flagged\ncandidate transients. Such filters include looking for known asteroids,\nknown variables, as well as moving, but previously uncatalogued objects\nbased on their motion within a scan as well as between successive scans.\nSome software filters also deal with instrumental artifacts, edge\neffects, and use clustering of spurious detections around bright stars.\nDuring a typical night when we cover about 500 sq. degrees, we detect\nhundreds of asteroids, the primary contaminants in the search for\nastrophysical transients beyond our solar system. Here we describe some\nstatistics based on the software filters we employ and the nature of the\nobjects that seem to survive the process. We also discuss the usefulness\nof this to amateur astronomers, projects like VOEventNet, and other\nsynoptic sky surveys. We also present an outline of the work we have\nstarted on quantifying the variability of quasars, blazars, as well as\nvarious classes of Galactic sources, by combining the large number of PQ\nscans with other existing data sources federated in the Virtual\nObservatory environment.

Using this type of approach, it should be\npossible to more accurately model the thin stem and other details of GW\n123.4-1.5 in the future.\nDO DOI: 10.1086/312592\n\n\nRT Conference Proceeding\nT1 Spacecraft navigation requirements\nA1 Miller, Judy L.\nAD AA(Draper (Charles Stark) Lab., Inc., Cambridge, MA.)\nJF In AGARD\nYR 1995\nFD 1995/06/1\nSP 390\nK1 Earth Orbits\nK1 Navigation Aids\nK1 Navigators\nK1 Onboard Equipment\nK1 Space Navigation\nK1 Spacecraft Trajectories\nK1 Support Systems\nK1 Technology Assessment\nK1 Technology Utilization\nK1 Ascent Trajectories\nK1 Reentry Trajectories\nK1 Spacecraft\nK1 Spacecraft Performance\nK1 Spacecraft Survivability\nK1 Tradeoffs\nK1 Weight (Mass)\nK1 Space Communications, Spacecraft Communications, Command and Tracking\nLK https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/1995ans..agar..390M\nAB Spacecraft operation depends upon knowledge of vehicular position and,\nconsequently, navigational support has been required for all such\nsystems. Technical requirements for different mission trajectories and\norbits are addressed with consideration given to the various tradeoffs\nwhich may need to be considered. The broad spectrum of spacecraft are\nconsidered with emphasis upon those of greater military significance\n(i.e., near earth orbiting satellites). Technical requirements include,\nbut are not limited to, accuracy; physical characteristics such as\nweight and volume; support requirements such as electrical power and\nground support; and system integrity. Generic navigation suites for\nspacecraft applications are described. It is shown that operational\nspacecraft rely primarily upon ground-based tracking and computational\ncenters with little or no navigational function allocated to the\nvehicle, while technology development efforts have been and continue to\nbe directed primarily toward onboard navigation suites. The military\nsignificance of onboard navigators is shown to both improve spacecraft\nsurvivability and performance (accuracy).\n\n\nRT Book, Whole\nT1 Applied nonlinear dynamics: analytical, computational and experimental methods\nA1 Nayfeh, Ali H.\nA1 Balachandran, Balakumar\nAD AA(-), AB(-)\nJF Wiley series in nonlinear science\nYR 1995\nFD 1995/01/1\nLK https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/1995anda.book.....N\n\n\nRT Journal\nT1 Autonomous navigation using lunar beacons\nA1 Khatib, A.

The lens antenna is made of an\nartificial material of metal particle. Comparing with our previous\nstudy, Anti-reflection (AR) layers are supplemented to the lens in this\nstudy to obtain a wave matching on the air-lens interface. The improved\nlens is in a disk shape of 50 mm diameter and 5.9 mm thickness. The lens\nis applied in a free-space setup, in which it is set in front of a patch\nantenna resonating at 15 GHz to get a high gain. The free-space setup is\nused to measure microwave attenuation and phase shift through a sawdust\nsample. The experimental results show that the multiple-reflection in\nthe free-space method becomes small, because the reflection on air-lens\ninterface has been reduced. The proposed AR lens antenna is flat and\nvery small in the size. It is possible to construct a very compact and\nlow cost free-space setup using the improved lens.\n\n\nPT  - Report\nTI  - Possible Overlaps Between Blobs, Grism Apertures, and Dithers\nAU  - Ryan, R.

Each aperture was designed to place the science target (e.g. a\nspecific star) on a cosmetically clean area of the IR detector.\nSimilarly, the dither patterns were designed to mitigate cosmetic\ndefects by rarely (or ideally never) placing such targets on known\ndefects. Because blobs accumulate with time, the originally defined\napertures and dither patterns may no longer accomplish their goals, it\nis important to reverify these combinations. We find two potential\noverlaps between the blob, aperture, and dither combinations, but do not\nrecommend any changes to the current suite of aperture references\npositions and/or dither patterns for two reasons. First, one of the\noverlaps occurs with a dither/aperture combination that is seldom used\nfor high-value science operations, but rather more common for wide-field\nsurveys/mosaics. Second, the other overlap is 8.7 pix from a blob that\nhas a fiducial radius of 10 pix, which already represents a very\nconservative distance. We conclude that a similar analysis should be\nrepeated as new blobs occur, to continue to ensure ideal operations for\nhigh-value science targets. The purpose of this report is to document\nthe analysis in order to facilitate its repetition in the future.\n\n\nPT  - Thesis\nTI  - Resolving Gas-Phase Metallicity In Galaxies\nAU  - Carton, David\nTA  - Ph.D. Thesis\nSO  - PhD Thesis, Leiden University, 2017\nDP  - 2017 Jun 01\n4099- https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017PhDT........14C\nAB  - Chapter 2: As part of the Bluedisk survey we analyse the radial gas-\nphase metallicity profiles of 50 late-type galaxies. We compare the\nmetallicity profiles of a sample of HI-rich galaxies against a control\nsample of HI-\'normal\' galaxies. We find the metallicity gradient of a\ngalaxy to be strongly correlated with its HI mass fraction {M}{HI}) /\n{M}_{\\ast}). We note that some galaxies exhibit a steeper metallicity\nprofile in the outer disc than in the inner disc. These galaxies are\nfound in both the HI-rich and control samples. This contradicts a\nprevious indication that these outer drops are exclusive to HI-rich\ngalaxies. These effects are not driven by bars, although we do find some\nindication that barred galaxies have flatter metallicity profiles. By\napplying a simple analytical model we are able to account for the\nvariety of metallicity profiles that the two samples present. The\nsuccess of this model implies that the metallicity in these isolated\ngalaxies may be in a local equilibrium, regulated by star formation.\nThis insight could provide an explanation of the observed local mass-\nmetallicity relation. Chapter 3 We present a method to recover the gas-\nphase metallicity gradients from integral field spectroscopic (IFS)\nobservations of barely resolved galaxies. We take a forward modelling\napproach and compare our models to the observed spatial distribution of\nemission line fluxes, accounting for the degrading effects of seeing and\nspatial binning. The method is flexible and is not limited to particular\nemission lines or instruments. We test the model through comparison to\nsynthetic observations and use downgraded observations of nearby\ngalaxies to validate this work. As a proof of concept we also apply the\nmodel to real IFS observations of high-redshift galaxies. From our\ntesting we show that the inferred metallicity gradients and central\nmetallicities are fairly insensitive to the assumptions made in the\nmodel and that they are reliably recovered for galaxies with sizes\napproximately equal to the half width at half maximum of the point-\nspread function. However, we also find that the presence of star forming\nclumps can significantly complicate the interpretation of metallicity\ngradients in moderately resolved high-redshift galaxies. Therefore we\nemphasize that care should be taken when comparing nearby well-resolved\nobservations to high-redshift observations of partially resolved\ngalaxies. Chapter 4 We present gas-phase metallicity gradients for 94\nstar-forming galaxies between (0.08 < z < 0.84). We find a negative\nmedian metallicity gradient of (-0.043^{+0.009}_{-0.007},\ndex/kpc)/span>, i.e. on average we find the centres of these galaxies to\nbe more metal-rich than their outskirts. However, there is significant\nscatter underlying this and we find that 10% (9) galaxies have\nsignificantly positive metallicity gradients, 39% (37) have\nsignificantly negative gradients, 28% (26) have gradients consistent\nwith being flat, the remainder 23% (22) are considered to have\nunreliable gradient estimates. We find a slight trend for a more\nnegative metallicity gradient with both increasing stellar mass and\nincreasing star formation rate (SFR). However, given the potential\nredshift and size selection effects, we do not consider these trends to\nbe significant. Indeed when we normalize the SFR of our galaxies\nrelative to the main sequence, we do not observe any trend between the\nmetallicity gradient and the normalized SFR. This finding is contrary to\nother recent studies of galaxies at similar and higher redshifts. We do,\nhowever, identify a novel trend between the metallicity gradient of a\ngalaxy and its size. Small galaxies ((r_d < 3 kpc)) present a large\nspread in observed metallicity gradients (both negative and positive\ngradients). In contrast, we find no large galaxies (r_d > 3 kpc) with\npositive metallicity gradients, and overall there is less scatter in the\nmetallicity gradient amongst the large galaxies. We suggest that these\nlarge (well-evolved) galaxies may be analogues of galaxies in the\npresent-day Universe, which also present a common negative metallicity\ngradient. Chapter 5 The relationship between a galaxy\'s stellar mass and\nits gas-phase metallicity results from the complex interplay between\nstar formation and the inflow and outflow of gas. Since the gradient of\nmetals in galaxies is also influenced by the same processes, it is\ntherefore natural to contrast the metallicity gradient with the mass-\nmetallicity relation. Here we study the interrelation of the stellar\nmass, central metallicity and metallicity gradient, using a sample of 72\ngalaxies spanning (0.13 < z < 0.84) with reliable metallicity gradient\nestimates. We find that typically the galaxies that fall below the mean\nmass-metallicity relation have flat or inverted metallicity gradients.\nWe quantify their relationship taking full account of the covariance\nbetween the different variables and find that at fixed mass the central\nmetallicity is anti-correlated with the metallicity gradient. We argue\nthat this is consistent with a scenario that suppresses the central\nmetallicity either through the inflow of metal poor gas or outflow of\nmetal enriched gas.\n\n\nPT  - Miscellaneous\nTI  - sick: Spectroscopic inference crank\nAU  - Casey, Andrew R.\nTA  - Astrophysics Source Code Library\nSO  - Astrophysics Source Code Library, record ascl:1706.009\nDP  - 2017 Jun 01\n4099- https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017ascl.soft06009C\nAB  - sick infers astrophysical parameters from noisy observed spectra.\nPhenomena that can alter the data (e.g., redshift, continuum,\ninstrumental broadening, outlier pixels) are modeled and simultaneously\ninferred with the astrophysical parameters of interest.

Magenta regions have redshifted line-of-sight\nvelocities (moving away from us); cyan regions have blueshifted light-\nof-sight velocities (moving toward us). [Williams et al. 2017]The Tycho\nsupernova remnant was first observed in the year 1572. Nearly 450 years\nlater, astronomers have now used X-ray observations of Tycho to build\nthe first-ever 3D map of a Type Ia supernova remnant.Signs of\nExplosionsSupernova remnants are spectacular structures formed by the\nejecta of stellar explosions as they expand outwards into the\nsurrounding interstellar medium.One peculiarity of these remnants is\nthat they often exhibit asymmetries in their appearance and motion. Is\nthis because the ejecta are expanding into a nonuniform interstellar\nmedium? Or was the explosion itself asymmetric? The best way we can\nexplore this question is with detailed observations of the\nremnants.Histograms of the velocity in distribution of the knots in the\nX (green), Y (blue) and Z (red) directions (+Z is away from the\nobserver). They show no evidence for asymmetric expansion of the knots.\n[Williams et al. 2017]Enter TychoTo this end, a team of scientists led\nby Brian Williams (Space Telescope Science Institute and NASA Goddard\nSFC) has worked to map out the 3D velocities of the ejecta in the Tycho\nsupernova remnant. Tycho is a Type Ia supernova thought to be caused by\nthe thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf in a binary system that was\ndestabilized by mass transfer from its companion.After 450 years of\nexpansion, the remnant now has the morphological appearance of a roughly\ncircular cloud of clumpy ejecta. The forward shock wave from the\nsupernova, however, is known to have twice the velocity on one side of\nthe shell as on the other.To better understand this asymmetry, Williams\nand collaborators selected a total of 57 knots in Tychos ejecta, spread\nout around the remnant. They then used 12 years of Chandra X-ray\nobservations to measure both the knots proper motion in the plane of the\nsky and their line-of-sight velocity. These two measurements were then\ncombined to build a full 3D map of the motion of the ejecta.3D\nhydrodynamical simulations of Tycho, stopped at the current epoch. These\nshow that both initially smooth (top) and initially clumpy (bottom)\nejecta models are consistent with the current observations of the\nmorphology and dynamics of Tychos ejecta. [Adapted from Williams et al.\n2017]Symmetry and ClumpsWilliams and collaborators found that the knots\nhave total velocities that range from 2400 to 6600 km/s. Unlike the\nforward shock of the supernova, Tychos ejecta display no asymmetries in\ntheir motion which suggests that the explosion itself was symmetric. The\nmore likely explanation is a density gradient in the interstellar\nmedium, which could slow the shock wave on one side of the remnant\nwithout yet affecting the motion of the clumps of ejecta.As a final\nexploration, the authors attempt to address the origin of Tychos\nclumpiness. The fact that some of Tychos ejecta knots precede its outer\nedge has raised the question of whether the ejecta started out clumpy,\nor if they began smooth and only clumped during expansion. Williams and\ncollaborators matched the morphological and dynamical data to\nsimulations, demonstrating that neither scenario can be ruled out at\nthis time.This first 3D map of a Type Ia supernova represents an\nimportant step in our ability to understand these stellar explosions.\nThe authors suggest that well be able to expand on this map in the\nfuture with additional observations from Chandra, as well as with new\ndata from future X-ray observatories that will be able to detect fainter\nemission.CitationBrian J.

Spectroscopy on a cadence of a week or two is\nrequested to monitor changes in the disk outflow. Investigator Adrian\nLucy writes: "Adrian Lucy and Dr. Jeno Sokoloski (Columbia University)\nhave requested spectroscopic monitoring of the broad-absorption-line\nsymbiotic star V694 Mon (MWC 560), as a follow-up to coordinated multi-\nwavelength observations obtained during its recent outburst (ATel #8653,\n#8832, #8957; #10281). This system is a perfect place in which to study\nthe relationship between an accretion disk and disk winds/jets, and a\nhigh-value target for which even low-resolution spectra can be\nextraordinarily useful...Optical brightening in MWC 560 tends to predict\nhigher-velocity absorption, but sometimes jumps in absorption velocity\nalso appear during optical quiescence (e.g., Iijima 2001, ASPCS, 242,\n187). If such a velocity jump occurs during photometric quiescence, it\nmay prompt radio observations to confirm and test the proposed outflow\norigin for recently-discovered flat-spectrum radio emission (Lucy et al.\nATel #10281)...Furthermore, volunteer spectroscopic monitoring of this\nsystem has proved useful in unpredictable ways. For example, \'amateur\'\nspectra obtained by Somogyi P\\u00c3\\u00a9ter in 2015 December\ndemonstrated that the velocity of absorption was very low only a month\nbefore an optical outburst peak prompted absorption troughs up to 3000\nkm/s, which constrains very well the timing of the changes to the\noutflow to a degree that would not have been otherwise possible. Any\nresolution can be useful. A wavelength range that can accommodate a\nblueshift of at least 140 angstroms (6000 km/s) from the rest\nwavelengths of H-alpha at 6562 angstroms and/or H-beta at 4861 angstroms\nis ideal, though spectra with a smaller range can still be useful.\nPhotometry could potentially still be useful, but will be supplementary\nto medium-cadence photometry being collected by the ANS collaboration."\n"Spectroscopy may be uploaded to the ARAS database\n(http://www.astrosurf.com/aras/Aras_DataBase/DataBase.htm), or sent to\nAdrian and Jeno directly at <lucy@astro.columbia.edu>.

In early 2017, using archival\nWISE data, we discovered that its 3.4 and 4.6um fluxes have been\nsteadily rising since 2013, increased by a factor of 3.5 and 2.6\nrespectively. The last epoch data from WISE on 2016-12-12 shows that\nF01004-2237 has reached 7.5 and 14mJy at 3.4 and 4.6um. We interpret the\nmid-IR LCs as infrared echoes from the earlier optical flare. We infer a\nconvex, dust ring with a radius of 1 pc from the central heating source.\nOur model predicts that if this event is indeed a TDE, its mid-IR LCs\nshould start to fade in next 5-12 months because it has already\nreprocessed most of the UV/optical energy from the tidal disruption.\nHowever, if this event is due to activities from an AGN, its mid-IR LCs\ncould last over a much longer time scale. We request a total of 3.2\nhours of Spitzer time to monitor the mid-IR variations in next 12\nmonths.

The surface and pointing accuracies for a\nradio telescope are much more stringent than that of a telecommunication\nantenna.

This manuscript is not an effort to\npresent an exhaustive, or even partial review of NMR spectroscopy\napplications, but rather to provide a glimpse at the wide-ranging uses\nof NMR spectroscopy found within the confines of a single magnetic\nresonance research facility, the Stanford Magnetic Resonance Laboratory.\nIncluded here are summaries of projects involving protein structure\ndetermination, mapping of intermolecular interactions, exploring\nfundamental biological mechanisms, following compound cycling in the\nenvironmental, analysis of synthetic solid compounds, and microimaging\nof a model organism.\n\n\nPT  - Conference\nTI  - Time Domain Exploration with the Palomar-QUEST Sky Survey\nAU  - Mahabal, Ashish A.\nAU  - Drake, A.

As four photometric bandpasses are\nutilized in nearly simultaneously, PQ is well suited to search for\ntransient and highly variable objects. Using a series of software\nfilters i.e. programs to select/deselect objects based on certain\ncriteria we shorten the list of candidates from the initially flagged\ncandidate transients. Such filters include looking for known asteroids,\nknown variables, as well as moving, but previously uncatalogued objects\nbased on their motion within a scan as well as between successive scans.\nSome software filters also deal with instrumental artifacts, edge\neffects, and use clustering of spurious detections around bright stars.\nDuring a typical night when we cover about 500 sq. degrees, we detect\nhundreds of asteroids, the primary contaminants in the search for\nastrophysical transients beyond our solar system. Here we describe some\nstatistics based on the software filters we employ and the nature of the\nobjects that seem to survive the process. We also discuss the usefulness\nof this to amateur astronomers, projects like VOEventNet, and other\nsynoptic sky surveys. We also present an outline of the work we have\nstarted on quantifying the variability of quasars, blazars, as well as\nvarious classes of Galactic sources, by combining the large number of PQ\nscans with other existing data sources federated in the Virtual\nObservatory environment. The PQ survey is partially supported by the\nU.S. National Science Foundation (NSF).\n\n\nPT  - Journal Article\nTI  - Analysis of Thermal Losses in the Flat-Plate Collector of a Thermosyphon Solar Water Heater\nAU  - ., S.

Observed as part of the Canadian Galactic\nPlane Survey, mushroom-shaped GW 123.4-1.5 extends only a few hundred\nparsecs, contains ~10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> of neutral hydrogen,\nand appears unrelated to a conventional shell or chimney structure. Our\npreliminary Zeus two-dimensional models use a single off-plane explosion\nwith a modest (~10<SUP>51</SUP> ergs) energy input. These generic\nsimulations generate, interior to an expanding outer blast wave, a\nbuoyant cloud whose structure resembles the morphology of the observed\nfeature. Unlike typical model superbubbles, the stem can be narrow\nbecause its width is not governed by the pressure behind the blast wave\nor the disk scale height. Using this type of approach, it should be\npossible to more accurately model the thin stem and other details of GW\n123.4-1.5 in the future.\n\n\nPT  - Conference\nTI  - Spacecraft navigation requirements\nAU  - Miller, Judy L.\nTA  - In AGARD\nSO  - In AGARD, Aerospace Navigation Systems p 390-405 (SEE N96-13404 02-04)\nDP  - 1995 Jun 01\n4099- https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/1995ans..agar..390M\nAB  - Spacecraft operation depends upon knowledge of vehicular position and,\nconsequently, navigational support has been required for all such\nsystems. Technical requirements for different mission trajectories and\norbits are addressed with consideration given to the various tradeoffs\nwhich may need to be considered. The broad spectrum of spacecraft are\nconsidered with emphasis upon those of greater military significance\n(i.e., near earth orbiting satellites). Technical requirements include,\nbut are not limited to, accuracy; physical characteristics such as\nweight and volume; support requirements such as electrical power and\nground support; and system integrity. Generic navigation suites for\nspacecraft applications are described. It is shown that operational\nspacecraft rely primarily upon ground-based tracking and computational\ncenters with little or no navigational function allocated to the\nvehicle, while technology development efforts have been and continue to\nbe directed primarily toward onboard navigation suites. The military\nsignificance of onboard navigators is shown to both improve spacecraft\nsurvivability and performance (accuracy).\n\n\nPT  - Book\nTI  - Applied nonlinear dynamics: analytical, computational and experimental methods\nAU  - Nayfeh, Ali H.\nAU  - Balachandran, Balakumar\nTA  - Wiley series in nonlinear science\nSO  - Wiley series in nonlinear science, New York; Chichester: Wiley, |c1995\nDP  - 1995 Jan 01\n4099- https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/1995anda.book.....N\n\n\nPT  - Journal Article\nTI  - Autonomous navigation using lunar beacons\nAU  - Khatib, A.

Spacecraft\nnavigation requires three position and three velocity elements to\nestablish location coordinates. Two beacons could be soft-landed on the\nlunar surface at the limits of allowable separation and each would\ntransmit a wide-beam signal with cones reaching GEO heights and be\nstrong enough to be received by small antennae in near-earth orbit. The\nblack box processor would perform on-board computation with one-way\nDoppler/range data and dynamical models. Alternatively, GEO satellites\nsuch as the GPS or TDRSS spacecraft can be used with interferometric\ntechniques to provide decimeter-level accuracy for aircraft navigation.\n\n\n'}
