    abstract = "{This paper describes a microwave free-space method using flat artificial
        lens antennas with anti-reflection layer. The lens antenna is
        made of an artificial material of metal particle. Comparing with
        our previous study, Anti-reflection (AR) layers are supplemented
        to the lens in this study to obtain a wave matching on the air-
        lens interface. The improved lens is in a disk shape of 50 mm
        diameter and 5.9 mm thickness. The lens is applied in a free-
        space setup, in which it is set in front of a patch antenna
        resonating at 15 GHz to get a high gain. The free-space setup is
        used to measure microwave attenuation and phase shift through a
        sawdust sample. The experimental results show that the multiple-
        reflection in the free-space method becomes small, because the
        reflection on air-lens interface has been reduced. The proposed
        AR lens antenna is flat and very small in the size. It is
        possible to construct a very compact and low cost free-space
        setup using the improved lens.}",

     journal = {AAVSO Special Notice},
    keywords = {astronomical databases: miscellaneous, binaries: symbiotic, stars:
        individual (V694 Mon, MWC 560)},
        year = 2017,
       month = May,
      volume = 429,
       pages = {1},
    abstract = "{The observing campaign from 2016 on V694 Mon (MWC 560) (AAVSO Alert
        Notice 538) has been continued, but with different requirements.
        Photometry is no longer specifically requested on a regular
        basis (although ongoing observations that do not interfere with
        other obligations are welcome). Spectroscopy on a cadence of a
        week or two is requested to monitor changes in the disk outflow.
        Investigator Adrian Lucy writes: "Adrian Lucy and Dr. Jeno
        Sokoloski (Columbia University) have requested spectroscopic
        monitoring of the broad-absorption-line symbiotic star V694 Mon
        (MWC 560), as a follow-up to coordinated multi-wavelength
        observations obtained during its recent outburst (ATel \#8653,
        \#8832, \#8957; \#10281). This system is a perfect place in
        which to study the relationship between an accretion disk and
        disk winds/jets, and a high-value target for which even low-
        resolution spectra can be extraordinarily useful...Optical
        brightening in MWC 560 tends to predict higher-velocity
        absorption, but sometimes jumps in absorption velocity also
        appear during optical quiescence (e.g., Iijima 2001, ASPCS, 242,
        187). If such a velocity jump occurs during photometric
        quiescence, it may prompt radio observations to confirm and test
        the proposed outflow origin for recently-discovered flat-
        spectrum radio emission (Lucy et al. ATel
        \#10281)...Furthermore, volunteer spectroscopic monitoring of
        this system has proved useful in unpredictable ways. For
        example, 'amateur' spectra obtained by Somogyi
        P\~{A}\copyrightter in 2015 December demonstrated that the
        velocity of absorption was very low only a month before an
        optical outburst peak prompted absorption troughs up to 3000
        km/s, which constrains very well the timing of the changes to
        the outflow to a degree that would not have been otherwise
        possible. Any resolution can be useful. A wavelength range that
        can accommodate a blueshift of at least 140 angstroms (6000
        km/s) from the rest wavelengths of H-alpha at 6562 angstroms
        and/or H-beta at 4861 angstroms is ideal, though spectra with a
        smaller range can still be useful. Photometry could potentially
        still be useful, but will be supplementary to medium-cadence
        photometry being collected by the ANS collaboration."

        oversimplify NMR spectros-copy by categorizing it into the two
        broad applications of structure elucidation of molecules

        justice in demonstrating its general acceptance and utilization

        an exhaustive, or even partial review of NMR spectroscopy
        applications, but rather to provide a glimpse at the wide-
        ranging uses of NMR spectroscopy found within the confines of a

        data from driftscans in real-time. As four photometric
        bandpasses are utilized in nearly simultaneously, PQ is well
        suited to search for transient and highly variable objects.
        Using a series of software filters i.e. programs to
        select/deselect objects based on certain criteria we shorten the
        list of candidates from the initially flagged candidate
        transients. Such filters include looking for known asteroids,
        known variables, as well as moving, but previously uncatalogued
        objects based on their motion within a scan as well as between
        successive scans. Some software filters also deal with
        instrumental artifacts, edge effects, and use clustering of
        spurious detections around bright stars. During a typical night
        when we cover about 500 sq. degrees, we detect hundreds of
        asteroids, the primary contaminants in the search for
        astrophysical transients beyond our solar system. Here we
        describe some statistics based on the software filters we employ
        and the nature of the objects that seem to survive the process.
        We also discuss the usefulness of this to amateur astronomers,
        projects like VOEventNet, and other synoptic sky surveys. We
        also present an outline of the work we have started on
        quantifying the variability of quasars, blazars, as well as
        various classes of Galactic sources, by combining the large
        number of PQ scans with other existing data sources federated in

        Galactic Plane Survey, mushroom-shaped GW 123.4-1.5 extends only
        a few hundred parsecs, contains \~{}10\^{}5 solar masses of
        neutral hydrogen, and appears unrelated to a conventional shell

        ergs) energy input. These generic simulations generate, interior
        to an expanding outer blast wave, a buoyant cloud whose
        structure resembles the morphology of the observed feature.
        Unlike typical model superbubbles, the stem can be narrow
        because its width is not governed by the pressure behind the
        blast wave nor the disk scale height. Using this type of
