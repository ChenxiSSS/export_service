        energies (about 0.04 - 2 MeV/nucleon) are studied during quiet
        periods in Solar Cycles (SC) 23 and 24 using data from the
        ULEIS/ACE instrument. In selecting quiet periods (the definition
        is given in Section 2.1), additional data from EPHIN/SOHO and
        EPAM/ACE were also used. The analysis of the ion energy spectra
        and their relative abundances shows that their behavior is
        governed by their first-ionization potential. Substantial
        differences in the ion energy spectra in two consecutive solar
        cycles are observed during the quiet periods selected. Quiet-
        time fluxes are divided into three distinct types according to
        the {\{}̃{\}} 80 - 320 keV/nucleon Fe/O ratio. Our results
        confirm the earlier observation that these types of suprathermal
        particles have different origins, that is, they represent
        different seed populations that are accelerated by different
        processes. Except for the solar activity minimum, the Fe/O ratio
        during quiet-time periods correspond either to the abundances of
        ions in particle fluxes accelerated in impulsive solar flares or
        to the mean abundances of elements in the solar corona. At the
        activity minimum, this ratio takes on values that are
        characteristic for the solar wind. These results indicate that
        the background fluxes of low-energy particles in the ascending,
        maximum, and decay phases of the solar cycle include significant
        contributions from both coronal particles accelerated to
        suprathermal energies and ions accelerated in small impulsive
        solar flares rich in Fe, while the contribution of remnants from
        earlier SEP events cannot be excluded. The comparison of
        suprathermal ion abundances during the first five years of SC 23
        and SC 24 suggests that the quiet-time and non-quiet fluxes of
        Fe and <SUP>3</SUP>He were lower in SC 24.}",

        (SED) in NS X-ray Nova Aql X-1 during the rise phase of a bright
        Fast-Rise-Exponential-Decay-type outburst in 2013 can be
        understood in the framework of thermal emission from non-
        stationary accretion disc with radial temperature distribution
        transforming from a single-temperature blackbody emitting ring
        into the multicolour irradiated accretion disc. SED evolution
        during the hard to soft X-ray state transition looks unusual, as
        it cannot be reproduced by the standard disc irradiation model
        with a single irradiation parameter for NUV, Optical and NIR
        spectral bands. NIR (NUV) band is correlated with soft (hard)
        X-ray flux changes during the state transition interval,
        respectively. In our interpretation, at the moment of X-ray
        state transition UV-emitting parts of the accretion disc are
        screened from direct X-ray illumination from the central source
        and are heated primarily by hard X-rays (E > 10 keV), scattered
        in the hot corona or wind possibly formed above the optically
        thick outer accretion flow; the outer edge of multicolour disc,
        which emits in Optical-NIR, can be heated primarily by direct
        X-ray illumination. We point out that future simultaneous
        multiwavelength observations of X-ray Nova systems during the
        fast X-ray state transition interval are of great importance, as
        it can serve as 'X-ray tomograph' to study physical conditions
        in outer regions of accretion flow. This can provide an
        effective tool to directly test the energy-dependent X-ray
        heating efficiency, vertical structure and accretion flow
        geometry in transient low-mass X-ray binaries.}",

    abstract = "{The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover carries a suite of
        meteorological detectors that constitute the Rover Environmental
        Monitoring Station (REMS) instrument. REMS investigates the
        meteorological conditions at Gale crater by obtaining high-
        frequency data of pressure, air and ground temperature, relative
        humidity, UV flux at the surface and wind intensity and
        direction with some limitations in the wind data. We have run a
        search of atmospheric pressure drops of short duration (< 25 s)
        and we present a statistical study of the frequency of these
        events in the REMS pressure data during its first 1417 sols
        (more than two Martian years). The identified daytime pressure
        drops could be caused by the close passages of warm vortices and
        dust devils. Previous systematic searches of warm vortices from
        REMS pressure data (Kahanp{\"a}{\"a} et al., 2016; Steakley and
        Murphy, 2016) cover about one Martian year. We show that sudden
        pressure drops are twice more abundant in the second Martian
        year [sols 671-1339] than in the first one analyzed in previous
        works. The higher number of detections could be linked to a
        combination of different topography, higher altitudes (120 m
        above the landing site) and true inter-annual meteorological
        variability. We found 1129 events with a pressure drop larger
        than 0.5 Pa. Of these, 635 occurred during the local daytime
        ({\ensuremath{\sim}}56{\%}) and 494 were nocturnal. The most
        intense pressure drop (4.2 Pa) occurred at daytime on sol 1417
        (areocentric solar longitude L<SUB>s</SUB> = 195{\textdegree})
        and was accompanied by a simultaneous decrease in the UV signal
        of 7.1{\%}, pointing to a true dust devil. We also discuss
        similar but less intense simultaneous pressure and UV radiation
        drops that constitute 0.7{\%} of all daytime events. Most of the
        intense daytime pressure drops with variations larger than 1.0
        Pa occur when the difference between air and ground temperature
        is larger than 15 K. Statistically, the frequency of daytime
        pressure drops peaks close to noon (12:00-13:00 Local True Solar
        Time or LTST) with more events in spring and summer
        (L<SUB>s</SUB> from 180{\textdegree} to 360{\textdegree}). The
        nocturnal sudden pressure drops concentrate in the 20:00-23:00
        LTST time interval and they only occur in spring and summer. We
        interpret these nocturnal events as a consequence of local
        mechanically forced turbulence. This interpretation is
        consistent with published results from simulations with the
        MRAMS model (Rafkin et al., 2016) that predict a competition
        between local orographic circulation and global Hadley cell
        circulation at Gale crater at summer night-time that can enhance
        forced turbulence at the surface. Bursts of pressure drops
        appear on particular sols, especially at night-time. Most of the
        vortex bursts occurred when MSL was in the region called Pahrump
        Hills characterized by a complex terrain. A comparison of the
        daytime pressure drops from REMS data with published results
        from the Pathfinder and Phoenix missions shows that the
        frequency of daytime events at Gale crater in spring and summer
        is similar to the one previously found at other locations.
        Finally, we present possible correlations between MSL activity
        and some daytime pressure drops. If such an instrumental effect
        is present in the REMS data its impact in this analysis is small
        and would only affect about 7{\%} of our detections.}",

    abstract = "{This work is the first study on the 3D shape of starbursting extremely
        metal-poor galaxies (XMPs; a galaxy is said to be an XMP if its
        ionized gas-phase metallicity is less than 1/10 the solar
        value). A few hundred XMPs have been identified in the local
        universe primarily through mining the spectroscopic catalog of
        the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and follow-up observations
        have shown that metallicity drops significantly at the starburst
        (compared to the quiescent component of the galaxy). As the
        timescale for gas mixing is short, the metal-poor gas triggering
        the starburst must have been accreted recently. This is strong
        observational evidence for the cold flow accretion predicted by
        cosmological models of galaxy formation, and, in this respect,
        XMPs seem to be the best local analogs of the very first
        galaxies.The ellipsoidal shape of a class of galaxies can be
        inferred from the observed axial ratio (q) distribution (q =
        minor axis/major axis) of a large sample of randomly-oriented
        galaxies. Fitting ellipses to 200 XMPs using r-band SDSS images,
        we observe that the axial ratio distribution falls off at q <
        ~0.4 and q > ~0.8, and we determine that these falloffs are not
        due to biases in the data. The falloff at low axial ratio
        indicates that the XMPs are thick for their size, and the
        falloff at high axial ratio suggests the vast majority of XMPs
        are triaxial. We also observe that smaller XMPs are thicker in
        proportion to their size, and it is expected that for decreasing
        galaxy size the ratio of random to rotational motions increases,
        which correlates with increasing relative thickness. The XMPs
        are low-redshift dwarf galaxies dominated by dark matter, and
        our results are compatible with simulations that have shown dark
        matter halos to be triaxial, with triaxial stellar distributions
        for low-mass galaxies and with triaxiality increasing over time.

        {\r{A}} wavebands are used for comparison among emissions at
        different heights in the transition region and low corona.
        Potential-field extrapolations of contemporaneous SDO/HMI line-
        of-sight magnetic fields provide a context in the physical
        environment. Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) shows that the
        variance of the fluctuations obeys a power-law as a function of
        temporal scales with periods in the range ~15-60 min. This
        scaling is characterized by a generalized Hurst exponent
        {\ensuremath{\alpha}}. In QS regions, and in regions within CHs
        that include magnetic bipoles, the scaling exponent lies in the
        range 1.0 < {\ensuremath{\alpha}} < 1.5, and it thus corresponds
        to anti-correlated, turbulent-like, dynamical processes. Regions
        inside the coronal holes primarily associated with magnetic
        field of a dominant single polarity, have a generalized exponent
        (0.5 < {\ensuremath{\alpha}} < 1) corresponding to positively
        correlated ({\textquotedblleft}persistent{\textquotedblright})

        {\textquotedblleft}superflares{\textquotedblright},
        10-10<SUP>4</SUP> times more energetic than the largest solar
        flares, occur on many G, K, M-type stars (e.g., Maehara+2012
        Nature). Harmful UV/X-ray radiation and high-energy particles
        such as protons are caused by such superflares. This may suggest
        that exoplanet host stars have severe effects on the physical
        and chemical evolution of exoplanetary atmospheres (cf.
        Segura+2010 Astrobiology, Takahashi+2016 ApJL).We here present
        statistical properties of superflares on G, K, M-type stars on
        the basis of our analyses of Kepler photometric data
        (Maehara+2012 Nature, Shibayama+2013 ApJS, Notsu+2013 ApJ,
        Canderaresi+2014 ApJ, Maehara+2015 EPS, Maehara+2017 PASJ). We
        found more than 5000 superflares on 800 G, K, M-type main-
        sequence stars, and the occurrence frequency (dN/dE) of
        superflares as a function of flare energy (E) shows the power-
        law distribution with the index of -1.8 -1.9. This power-law
        distribution is consistent with that of solar flares.Flare
        frequency increases as stellar temperature decreases. As for
        M-type stars, energy of the largest flares is smaller compared
        with G,K-type stars, but more frequent
        {\textquotedblleft}hazardous{\textquotedblright} flares for the
        habitable planets since the habitable zone around M-type stars
        is much smaller compared with G, K-type stars.Rotation period
        and starspot coverage can be estimated from the quasi-periodic
        brightness variation of the superflare stars. The intensity of
        Ca II 8542 line of superflare stars, which is measured from
        spectroscopic observations with Subaru Telescope, has a well
        correlation with the brightness variation amplitude
        (Notsu+2015a{\&}b PASJ).Flare frequency has a correlation with
        rotation period, and this suggests young rapidly-rotating stars
        (like {\textquotedblleft}young Sun{\textquotedblright}) have
        more severe impacts of flares on the planetary atmosphere (cf.
        Airapetian+2016 ApJL). Flare energy and frequency also depends
        on starspot coverage, and this suggests existence of large
        starspots is important factor of superflares.These statistical
        properties of superflares discussed here can be one of the basic
        information for considering the impacts of flares on planet-host
        stars.}",

        that NASA restore support for a gravitational wave mission in
        this decade with the goal of realizing the full scientific
        capability of the mission envisioned in the 2020 decadal. NASA
        has appointed the L3 Study Team, charged with providing analysis
        of potential U.S. contributions to the European-led L3 mission
        and preparing for the next decadal survey. The LISA mission
        concept, proposed for L3, will improve our understanding of the
        formation and growth of massive black holes, create a census of
        compact binary systems in the Milky Way, test general relativity

        The purpose of this Special Notice is to alert observers right
        now to the need to monitor SS Cyg very closely and report your
        observations to the AAVSO via WebObs at once. It is likely to go
        into outburst very soon, and immediate reporting of outburst
        behavior is crucial to the success of the campaign. Previous
        similar campaigns with Dr. James Miller-Jones and his colleagues
        have been very successful. AAVSO observations are used to
        trigger multi-site radio observations of SS Cyg in research on
        radio emission from this dwarf nova, as well as for correlation
        with the radio data during analysis. Visual and CCD/DSLR
        (particularly V) observations are requested (no time series
        unless outburst is underway and radio observations have been
        triggered). Its normal minimum magnitude is 11.8 V, but it can
        fluctuate to around 11.5. If it becomes brighter than 11.5 V, it
        could well be going into outburst. If it reaches 11.0, it is
        almost certainly on its way up. Please report your observations
        of SS Cyg to the AAVSO as soon after you make them as possible.
        If you see it 11.5 or brighter, please report them immediately.
        Finder charts with sequence may be created using the AAVSO
        Variable Star Plotter (https://www.aavso.org/vsp). Observations
        should be submitted to the AAVSO International Database. See

        galaxies at z~1 are no different from those of inactive galaxies
        once stellar mass selection effects are taken into account.
        However, there is a clear deficit of AGN among quiescent
        galaxies, and the average star formation rates of AGN hosts are
        comparable or higher than those of inactive star-forming
        galaxies. These apparently contradictory findings could be a
        consequence of higher extinction in star-forming AGN hosts
        compensating for their younger stellar populations in observed
        colours. In this talk I will present a new method of extinction
        correction that breaks the degeneracy with stellar age and
        metallicity by comparing the restframe U-V colour with
        measurements of the Dn(4000) index on intermediate band
        photospectra from SHARDS. I'll show that the distribution of
        extinction corrected U-V colours and Dn(4000) for AGN hosts at
        z<1 is significantly different from that of comparison samples
        of inactive galaxies, with a clear deficit of AGN in intrinsic
        red galaxies and a higher prevalence among those with
        intermediate age stellar populations.}",

%B Accurate flux calibration for the STIS echelle modes is heavily
dependent on the proper alignment of the blaze function for each
spectral order. However, due to changes in the instrument alignment over
time and between exposures, the blaze function can shift in wavelength.
This may result in flux calibration inconsistencies of up to 10%. We
present the stisblazefix Python module as a tool for STIS users to
correct their echelle spectra. The stisblazefix module assumes that the
error in the blaze alignment is a linear function of spectral order, and
finds the set of shifts that minimizes the flux inconsistencies in the
overlap between spectral orders. We discuss the uses and limitations of
this tool, and show that its use can provide significant improvements to
the default pipeline flux calibration for many observations.

%B The fluxes of <SUP>3</SUP>He, <SUP>4</SUP>He, C, O, and Fe ions at low
energies (about 0.04 - 2 MeV/nucleon) are studied during quiet periods
in Solar Cycles (SC) 23 and 24 using data from the ULEIS/ACE instrument.
In selecting quiet periods (the definition is given in Section 2.1),
additional data from EPHIN/SOHO and EPAM/ACE were also used. The
analysis of the ion energy spectra and their relative abundances shows
that their behavior is governed by their first-ionization potential.
Substantial differences in the ion energy spectra in two consecutive
solar cycles are observed during the quiet periods selected. Quiet-time
fluxes are divided into three distinct types according to the {̃} 80 -
320 keV/nucleon Fe/O ratio. Our results confirm the earlier observation
that these types of suprathermal particles have different origins, that
is, they represent different seed populations that are accelerated by
different processes. Except for the solar activity minimum, the Fe/O
ratio during quiet-time periods correspond either to the abundances of
ions in particle fluxes accelerated in impulsive solar flares or to the
mean abundances of elements in the solar corona. At the activity
minimum, this ratio takes on values that are characteristic for the
solar wind. These results indicate that the background fluxes of low-
energy particles in the ascending, maximum, and decay phases of the
solar cycle include significant contributions from both coronal
particles accelerated to suprathermal energies and ions accelerated in
small impulsive solar flares rich in Fe, while the contribution of
remnants from earlier SEP events cannot be excluded. The comparison of
suprathermal ion abundances during the first five years of SC 23 and SC
24 suggests that the quiet-time and non-quiet fluxes of Fe and
<SUP>3</SUP>He were lower in SC 24.

%B We present a speckle survey of Hipparcos visual doubles and
spectroscopic binary stars identified by the Geneva-Copenhagen
spectroscopic survey with the SOAR 4m telescope + HRCam. These systems
represent our best chance to take advantage of Gaia parallaxes for the
purpose of stellar mass determinations. Many of these systems already
have mass fractions (although generally no spectroscopic orbit - an
astrometric orbit will determine individual masses), metallicity
information, and Hipparcos distances. They will be used to improve our
knowledge of the mass-luminosity relation, particularly for lower-
metallicity stars. Our survey will create the first all-sky, volume-
limited, speckle archive for the two primary samples, complementing a
similar effort that has been recently been completed at the WIYN 3.5-m
telescope in the Northern Hemisphere. This extension to the Southern
Hemisphere will fill out the picture for a wider metallicity range.

%B We show that in any spacetime dimension D ≥ 4, degenerate components of
the event horizon do not exist in static vacuum configurations with
positive cosmological constant. We also show that without a cosmological
constant asymptotically flat solutions cannot possess a degenerate
horizon component. Several independent proofs are presented. One proof
follows easily from differential geometry in the near-horizon limit,
while others use Bakry-Émery-Ricci bounds for static Einstein manifolds.

%B Due to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration and its effect on global
climates, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
proposes a Clean Power Plan (CPP) mandating CO2 reductions which will
likely force the early retirement of inefficient, aging power plants.
Consequentially, removing these plants equates to a shortfall of
approximately 66 GW of electricity. These factors add to the looming
resource problems of choosing whether to build large replacement power
plants or consider alternative energy sources as a means to help close
the gap between electricity supply and demand in a given region. One
energy source, shallow water tidal currents, represents opportunities to
convert kinetic energy to mechanical forms and provide electricity to
homes and businesses. Nearly 2,000 National Oceanic Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) tidal current data points from Maine to Texas are
considered. This paper, based on systems engineering thinking, provides
key attributes (e.g. turbine efficiency, array size, transmission
losses) for consideration as decision makers seek to identify where to
site Marine Hydrokinetic (MHK) systems and the number of homes powered
by the practical harvest of electricity from tidal currents at those
locations with given attributes. A systems engineering process model is
proposed for consideration as is a regression based equation to estimate
MHK machine parameters needed for power a given number of homes.

%B This spectacular composite (click here for the full image) reveals the
galaxy cluster 1RXS J0603.3+4214, known as the Toothbrush cluster due to
the shape of its most prominent radio relic. Featured in a recent
publication led by Kamlesh Rajpurohit (Thuringian State Observatory,
Germany), this image contains new Very Large Array (VLA) 1.5-GHz
observations (red) showing the radio emission within the cluster. This
is composited with a Chandra view of the X-ray emitting gas of the
cluster (blue) and an optical image of the background from Subaru data.
The new deep VLA data totaling 26 hours of observations provides a
detailed look at the complex structure within the Toothbrush relic,
revealing enigmatic filaments and twists (see below). This new data will
help us to explore the possible merger history of this cluster, which is
theorized to have caused the unusual shapes we see today. For more
information, check out the original article linked below.High resolution

%B The observed evolution of the broad-band spectral energy distribution
(SED) in NS X-ray Nova Aql X-1 during the rise phase of a bright Fast-
Rise-Exponential-Decay-type outburst in 2013 can be understood in the
framework of thermal emission from non-stationary accretion disc with
radial temperature distribution transforming from a single-temperature
blackbody emitting ring into the multicolour irradiated accretion disc.
SED evolution during the hard to soft X-ray state transition looks
unusual, as it cannot be reproduced by the standard disc irradiation
model with a single irradiation parameter for NUV, Optical and NIR
spectral bands. NIR (NUV) band is correlated with soft (hard) X-ray flux
changes during the state transition interval, respectively. In our
interpretation, at the moment of X-ray state transition UV-emitting
parts of the accretion disc are screened from direct X-ray illumination
from the central source and are heated primarily by hard X-rays (E > 10
keV), scattered in the hot corona or wind possibly formed above the
optically thick outer accretion flow; the outer edge of multicolour
disc, which emits in Optical-NIR, can be heated primarily by direct
X-ray illumination. We point out that future simultaneous
multiwavelength observations of X-ray Nova systems during the fast X-ray
state transition interval are of great importance, as it can serve as
'X-ray tomograph' to study physical conditions in outer regions of
accretion flow. This can provide an effective tool to directly test the
energy-dependent X-ray heating efficiency, vertical structure and
accretion flow geometry in transient low-mass X-ray binaries.

%B The Karl Schwarzschild Meeting 2017 (KSM2017) has been the third
instalment of the conference dedicated to the great Frankfurter
scientist, who derived the first black hole solution of Einstein's
equations about 100 years ago. The event has been a 5 day meeting in the
field of black holes, AdS/CFT correspondence and gravitational physics.
Like the two previous instalments, the conference continued to attract a
stellar ensemble of participants from the world's most renowned
institutions. The core of the meeting has been a series of invited talks
from eminent experts (keynote speakers) as well as the presence of
plenary research talks by students and junior speakers.

%B The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover carries a suite of
meteorological detectors that constitute the Rover Environmental
Monitoring Station (REMS) instrument. REMS investigates the
meteorological conditions at Gale crater by obtaining high-frequency
data of pressure, air and ground temperature, relative humidity, UV flux
at the surface and wind intensity and direction with some limitations in
the wind data. We have run a search of atmospheric pressure drops of
short duration (< 25 s) and we present a statistical study of the
frequency of these events in the REMS pressure data during its first
1417 sols (more than two Martian years). The identified daytime pressure
drops could be caused by the close passages of warm vortices and dust
devils. Previous systematic searches of warm vortices from REMS pressure
data (Kahanpää et al., 2016; Steakley and Murphy, 2016) cover about one
Martian year. We show that sudden pressure drops are twice more abundant
in the second Martian year [sols 671-1339] than in the first one
analyzed in previous works. The higher number of detections could be
linked to a combination of different topography, higher altitudes (120 m
above the landing site) and true inter-annual meteorological
variability. We found 1129 events with a pressure drop larger than 0.5
Pa. Of these, 635 occurred during the local daytime (∼56%) and 494 were
nocturnal. The most intense pressure drop (4.2 Pa) occurred at daytime
on sol 1417 (areocentric solar longitude L<SUB>s</SUB> = 195°) and was
accompanied by a simultaneous decrease in the UV signal of 7.1%,
pointing to a true dust devil. We also discuss similar but less intense
simultaneous pressure and UV radiation drops that constitute 0.7% of all
daytime events. Most of the intense daytime pressure drops with
variations larger than 1.0 Pa occur when the difference between air and
ground temperature is larger than 15 K. Statistically, the frequency of
daytime pressure drops peaks close to noon (12:00-13:00 Local True Solar
Time or LTST) with more events in spring and summer (L<SUB>s</SUB> from
180° to 360°). The nocturnal sudden pressure drops concentrate in the
20:00-23:00 LTST time interval and they only occur in spring and summer.
We interpret these nocturnal events as a consequence of local
mechanically forced turbulence. This interpretation is consistent with
published results from simulations with the MRAMS model (Rafkin et al.,
2016) that predict a competition between local orographic circulation
and global Hadley cell circulation at Gale crater at summer night-time
that can enhance forced turbulence at the surface. Bursts of pressure
drops appear on particular sols, especially at night-time. Most of the
vortex bursts occurred when MSL was in the region called Pahrump Hills
characterized by a complex terrain. A comparison of the daytime pressure
drops from REMS data with published results from the Pathfinder and
Phoenix missions shows that the frequency of daytime events at Gale
crater in spring and summer is similar to the one previously found at
other locations. Finally, we present possible correlations between MSL
activity and some daytime pressure drops. If such an instrumental effect
is present in the REMS data its impact in this analysis is small and
would only affect about 7% of our detections.

%B It has been shown by van den Berg and Steif that the sub-critical Ising
model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ is a finitary factor of a finite-valued i.i.d.
process. We strengthen this by showing that the factor map can be made
to have finite expected coding volume (in fact, stretch-exponential
tails), answering a question of van den Berg and Steif. The result holds
at any temperature above the critical temperature. An analogous result
holds for Markov random fields satisfying a high-noise assumption and
for proper colorings with a large number of colors.

%B CCAT-prime is a 6-m submillimeter telescope that is being built on the
top of Cerro Chajnantor (5600 m altitude) overlooking the ALMA plateau
in the Atacama Desert. Its novel Crossed-Dragone design enables a large
field of view without blockage and is thus particularly well suited for
large scale surveys in the continuum and spectral lines targeting
important questions ranging from star formation in the Milky Way to
cosmology. On this poster, we focus on the large scale mapping
opportunities in important spectral cooling lines of the interstellar
medium opened up by CCAT-prime and the Cologne heterodyne instrument
CHAI.

%B This work is the first study on the 3D shape of starbursting extremely
metal-poor galaxies (XMPs; a galaxy is said to be an XMP if its ionized
gas-phase metallicity is less than 1/10 the solar value). A few hundred
XMPs have been identified in the local universe primarily through mining
the spectroscopic catalog of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and
follow-up observations have shown that metallicity drops significantly
at the starburst (compared to the quiescent component of the galaxy). As
the timescale for gas mixing is short, the metal-poor gas triggering the
starburst must have been accreted recently. This is strong observational
evidence for the cold flow accretion predicted by cosmological models of
galaxy formation, and, in this respect, XMPs seem to be the best local
analogs of the very first galaxies.The ellipsoidal shape of a class of
galaxies can be inferred from the observed axial ratio (q) distribution
(q = minor axis/major axis) of a large sample of randomly-oriented
galaxies. Fitting ellipses to 200 XMPs using r-band SDSS images, we
observe that the axial ratio distribution falls off at q < ~0.4 and q >
~0.8, and we determine that these falloffs are not due to biases in the
data. The falloff at low axial ratio indicates that the XMPs are thick
for their size, and the falloff at high axial ratio suggests the vast
majority of XMPs are triaxial. We also observe that smaller XMPs are
thicker in proportion to their size, and it is expected that for
decreasing galaxy size the ratio of random to rotational motions
increases, which correlates with increasing relative thickness. The XMPs
are low-redshift dwarf galaxies dominated by dark matter, and our
results are compatible with simulations that have shown dark matter
halos to be triaxial, with triaxial stellar distributions for low-mass
galaxies and with triaxiality increasing over time. We will offer
precise constraints on the 3D shape of XMPs via Bayesian analysis of our
observed axial ratio distribution.This work has been supported by the La
Caixa Foundation and the Estallidos Spanish Ministry of Science and
Innovation grant.

%B Studies in the last 10 years of dust formation in core-collapse
supernovae (CCSNe) have found only small amounts, 0.001 solar masses.
This is far less than the amount needed to account for the large masses
of dust seen in some high redshift galaxies. However, the recent
discovery of 1 solar mass of cold dust in the ejecta of SN 1987A has has
caused a complete re-evaluation of dust formation in CCSNe. It has been
suggested that the CCSNe are continuously forming dust so that by the
time they are about 25 years old they will have dust masses similar to
SN 1987A. However, there is a wide time gap between the CCSNe that have
been studied recently and SN 1987A. We plan to use the sensitivity of
Spitzer to detect dust emission from SN 2017eaw at two epochs less than
a year after explosion. Radiative transfer models will be used to
estimate the dust masses. These observations will provide a necessary
baseline for our proposed JWST DD ERS observations. This is part of a
long term study to look for evidence of continuous dust formation in
CCSNe. These observations will help shed light on the mystery of dust in
the early universe. SSC Note: A 2019 epoch was added by the TAC.

%B We investigate the scaling properties of EUV intensity fluctuations seen
in low-latitude coronal holes (CH) and in regions of Quiet Sun (QS), in
signals obtained with the SDO/AIA instrument in the 193 Å waveband.
Contemporaneous time series in the 171 and 211 Å wavebands are used for
comparison among emissions at different heights in the transition region
and low corona. Potential-field extrapolations of contemporaneous
SDO/HMI line-of-sight magnetic fields provide a context in the physical
environment. Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) shows that the
variance of the fluctuations obeys a power-law as a function of temporal
scales with periods in the range ~15-60 min. This scaling is
characterized by a generalized Hurst exponent α. In QS regions, and in
regions within CHs that include magnetic bipoles, the scaling exponent
lies in the range 1.0 < α < 1.5, and it thus corresponds to anti-
correlated, turbulent-like, dynamical processes. Regions inside the
coronal holes primarily associated with magnetic field of a dominant
single polarity, have a generalized exponent (0.5 < α < 1) corresponding
to positively correlated (“persistent”) processes. The results indicate
the influence of the magnetic fields on the dynamics of the emission.

%B Flares are thought to be sudden releases of magnetic energy stored
around starspots. Recent space high-precision photometry shows
“superflares”, 10-10<SUP>4</SUP> times more energetic than the largest
solar flares, occur on many G, K, M-type stars (e.g., Maehara+2012
Nature). Harmful UV/X-ray radiation and high-energy particles such as
protons are caused by such superflares. This may suggest that exoplanet
host stars have severe effects on the physical and chemical evolution of
exoplanetary atmospheres (cf. Segura+2010 Astrobiology, Takahashi+2016
ApJL).We here present statistical properties of superflares on G, K,
M-type stars on the basis of our analyses of Kepler photometric data
(Maehara+2012 Nature, Shibayama+2013 ApJS, Notsu+2013 ApJ,
Canderaresi+2014 ApJ, Maehara+2015 EPS, Maehara+2017 PASJ). We found
more than 5000 superflares on 800 G, K, M-type main-sequence stars, and
the occurrence frequency (dN/dE) of superflares as a function of flare
energy (E) shows the power-law distribution with the index of -1.8 -1.9.
This power-law distribution is consistent with that of solar
flares.Flare frequency increases as stellar temperature decreases. As
for M-type stars, energy of the largest flares is smaller compared with
G,K-type stars, but more frequent “hazardous” flares for the habitable
planets since the habitable zone around M-type stars is much smaller
compared with G, K-type stars.Rotation period and starspot coverage can
be estimated from the quasi-periodic brightness variation of the
superflare stars. The intensity of Ca II 8542 line of superflare stars,
which is measured from spectroscopic observations with Subaru Telescope,
has a well correlation with the brightness variation amplitude
(Notsu+2015a&b PASJ).Flare frequency has a correlation with rotation
period, and this suggests young rapidly-rotating stars (like “young
Sun”) have more severe impacts of flares on the planetary atmosphere
(cf. Airapetian+2016 ApJL). Flare energy and frequency also depends on
starspot coverage, and this suggests existence of large starspots is
important factor of superflares.These statistical properties of
superflares discussed here can be one of the basic information for
considering the impacts of flares on planet-host stars.

%B Different groups of meteorites have distinctive isotopic compositions.
In a 2011 paper, Paul Warren (University of California, Los Angeles)
showed that there is a clear dichotomy in chromium and titanium isotopic
compositions between carbonaceous chondrites and all the other types of
stony meteorites, plus Earth, Moon, and Mars. Thomas Kruijer (Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, California and University of Münster,
Germany) and colleagues at the University of Münster now show that the
dichotomy involves iron meteorites as well as rocky ones. The two
distinct groups were nicknamed the CC (those with isotopes like
carbonaceous chondrites) and NC (those with isotopes like non-
carbonaceous meteorites). Kruijer and colleagues were able to determine
the time of core formation in the planetesimals in which iron meteorites
formed and report that CC iron meteorites formed 2.2 to 2.8 million
years after CAI formation, whereas the NC iron meteorites formed
earlier, before 1.8 million years after CAIs. (CAIs, calcium-aluminum-
rich inclusions, are the first solids to form in the Solar System and
give us a time-zero reference marker.) The accretion of the
planetesimals preceded core formation. Thermal calculations done by
Kruijer and colleagues indicate that NC objects accreted at 0.4 million
years after CAIs. In contrast, the CC objects accreted at 0.9 million
years after CAIs. Kruijer and colleagues suggest on the basis of their
results and published models for the formation of Jupiter that the
dichotomy resulted from Jupiter's formation. The NC materials accreted
when there was a continuous gas disk characterized by solids flowing
inwards towards the Sun. However, less than a million years later,
something interrupted this continuous flow, leading to formation of the
isotopic dichotomy. Kruijer and coworkers suggest that rapid accretion
of Jupiter's solid, mostly rocky core was the event that disrupted the
continuous inwards flow. Models suggest that Jupiter would have grown to
about 20 Earth masses, after which it grew by accreting gases to it. The
ages of the NC and CC iron meteorite groups indicate that Jupiter's
rocky core formed about 1 million years after CAIs. Sophisticated models
for planetary accretion predict early formation of the rocky core of
Jupiter, but suggest this process took between 1 and 10 million years
(after CAIs). Quantitative meteorite data show that the time was around
a million years, providing useful input for improving the models and
showing the value of combining theory with data on ancient samples.

%B Fluctuations are one of the main probes of the physics of the new state
of hot and dense nuclear matter called the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP)
which is created in the ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. In this
dissertation we extend and improve upon the existing descriptions of
heavy ion collisions in three different directions: we study the new
signatures of initial state fluctuations, the propagation of
perturbations in the early stages of the collision, and the effect of
thermal fluctuations on the hydrodynamic expansion of the QGP. First, in
Chapter 3 we study initial state fluctuations by examining the complete
statistical information contained in the two-particle correlation
measurements in hydrodynamic simulations of Pb+Pb collisions at the CERN
Large Hadron Collider (√sNN = 2.76 TeV). We use Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) to decompose the spectrum of harmonic flow, v_n(p_T) for
n = 0-5, into dominant components. The leading component is identified
with the standard event plane vn(pT), while the subleading component
describes additional fluctuations in the two-particle correlation
function. We find good geometric predictors for the orientation and the
magnitude of the leading and the subleading flows. The subleading v 0,
v1, and v3 flow harmonics are shown to be a response to the radial
excitation of the corresponding eccentricity epsilonn. In contrast, for
v2 the subleading flow in peripheral collisions is dominated by the
nonlinear mixing between the leading elliptic flow and radial flow
fluctuations. Nonlinear mixing also plays a significant role in
generating subleading v4 and v 5 harmonics. The PCA gives a systematic
way of studying the full information of the two-particle correlation
matrix and identifying the subleading flows, which we show are
responsible for factorization breaking in hydrodynamics. Second, in
Chapter 4 we study the thermalization and hydrodynamization of
fluctuations at the early stages of heavy ion collisions. We use leading
order effective kinetic theory, accurate at weak coupling, to simulate
the pre-equilibrium evolution of transverse energy and flow
perturbations. For the short evolution we can use a linear response
theory to construct the pre-equilibrium Green functions. Then the
energy-momentum tensor at a time when hydrodynamics becomes applicable
can be expressed as a linear convolution of response functions with the
initial perturbations. We propose combining effective kinetic theory
with weak coupling initial state models, such as IP-Glasma, to model the
complete pre-thermal evolution from saturated nuclei to hydrodynamics in
a weak coupling framework. Last, in Chapter 5 we consider out-of-
equilibrium hydrodynamic fluctuations in the expanding QGP. We develop a
set of kinetic equations for a correlator of thermal fluctuations which
are equivalent to nonlinear hydrodynamics with noise. We first show that
the kinetic response precisely reproduces the one-loop renormalization
of the shear viscosity for a static fluid. We then use the hydro-kinetic
equations to analyze thermal fluctuations for a Bjorken expansion. The
steady state solution to the kinetic equations determine the coefficient
of the first fractional power of the gradient expansion (infinity 1/(tau
T)3/2), which was computed here for the first time. The formalism of
hydro-kinetic equations can be applied to more general background flows
and coupled to existing viscous hydrodynamic codes to incorporate the
physics of hydrodynamic fluctuations.

%B How do magnetic fields form and evolve in early galaxies? A new study
has provided some clever observations to help us answer this
question.The Puzzle of Growing FieldsDynamo theory is the primary model
describing how magnetic fields develop in galaxies. In this picture,
magnetic fields start out as weak seed fields that are small and
unordered. These fields then become ordered and amplified by large-scale
rotation and turbulence in galaxy disks and halos, eventually leading to
the magnetic fields we observe in galaxies today.Schematic showinghow to
indirectly measure protogalactic magnetic fields. The measured
polarization of a background quasar is altered by the fields in a
foreground protogalaxy. Click for a closer look! [Farnes et al.
2017/Adolf Schaller/STSCI/NRAO/AUI/NSF]To test this model, we need
observations of the magnetic fields in young protogalaxies.
Unfortunately, we dont have the sensitivity to be able to measure these
fields directly but a team of scientists led by Jamie Farnes (Radboud
University in the Netherlands) have come up with a creative
alternative.The key is to find early protogalaxies that absorb the light
of more distant background objects. If a protogalaxy lies between us and
a distant quasar, then magnetic fields of the protogalaxy if present
will affect the polarization measurements of the background
quasar.Observing Galactic Building BlocksTop: Redshift distribution for
the background quasars in the authors sample. Bottom: Redshift
distribution for the foreground protogalaxies the authors are exploring.
[Farnes et al. 2017]Farnes and collaborators examined two types of
foreground protogalaxies: Damped Lyman-Alpha Absorbers (DLAs) and Lyman
Limit Systems (LLSs). They obtained polarimetric data for a sample of
114 distant quasars with nothing in the foreground (the control sample),
19 quasars with DLAs in the foreground, and 27 quasars with LLSs in the
foreground. They then used statistical analysis techniques to draw
conclusions about the magnetic fields in the foreground
protogalaxies.Farnes and collaborators were unable to detect either
coherent or random magnetic fields in DLAs. LLSs, however, showed some
evidence of coherent magnetic fields and significant evidence of
incoherent magnetic fields. The observations show that the magnetized
gas in LLSs must be highly turbulent on a scale of 520 parsecs similar
to turbulence scales in the Milky Way.Support for DynamosWhat do these
observations imply? Both support the dynamo theory of magnetic field
growth in galaxies!Polarization fraction distributions (top) and their
logarithms (bottom) for sources with and without protogalaxies in the
foreground (pink for DLAs, blue for LLSs, and grey for no intervenor).
Statistical analysis reveals that the distribution for LLSs differs from
the control sample, indicating the presence of magnetized gas. [Adapted
from Farnes et al. 2017]The DLAs appear to consist of mostly non-
turbulent quiescent gas; no dynamo action is currently occurring in
these protogalaxies. The LLSs, on the other hand, appear to be growing
their random magnetic fields via a turbulent dynamo. Thefields have not
yet had enough time to become ordered like the fields of more evolved
galaxies, however.Farnes and collaborators data indicate that magnetic
fields are indeed being gradually built up in early galaxies by dynamos.
They also suggest that DLAs may represent an earlier galactic
evolutionary stage than LLSs, as DLAs havent yet had the time to develop
their magnetic fields to a detectable level.A future increase in sample
size will certainly help improve our understanding of the field
formation process. In the meantime, the data in this study provide the
first observational picture of magnetic field evolution in galaxies,
lending excellent support to theoretical models.CitationJ. S. Farnes et

%B Hurricane Bonnie (1998) was an unusually resilient hurricane that
maintained intensity in 12-16 ms-1 vertical wind shear and during an
eyewall replacement cycle from 23-25 August. This remarkable behavior
was examined using observations from flight-level data, microwave
imagery, radar, and dropsondes over the two-day period. The symmetric
and asymmetric aspects of Bonnie's eyewall replacement cycle were
documented and compared to eyewall replacement cycles in other
hurricanes. Similar to other observed eyewall replacement cycles, Bonnie
exhibited the development, strengthening, and dominance of a secondary
eyewall while a primary eyewall decayed. However, Bonnie's structure was
highly asymmetric due to strong 12-16 ms-1 vertical wind shear, in
contrast to the more symmetric structures observed in other hurricanes
undergoing eyewall replacement cycles. It is hypothesized that strong
shear preferentially forced convection downshear, which was able to
extend upshear and form a secondary eyewall through enhanced surface
fluxes upshear. The larger radius of maximum winds after the eyewall
replacement cycle completed might have aided Bonnie's resiliency in
shear by increasing the likelihood that diabatic heating would fall
inside the radius of maximum winds. These observations of Hurricane
Bonnie's ability to maintain intensity in spite of high shear and an
eyewall replacement cycle, both of which usually result in weakening,
provide a new direction from which to view the intensity change issue in
hurricanes.

%B Icy grain mantles are the main reservoir for volatile elements in star-
forming regions across the Universe, as well as the formation site of
pre-biotic complex organic molecules (COMs) seen in our Solar System. We
propose to trace the evolution of pristine and complex ice chemistry in
a representative low-mass star-forming region through observations of a:
pre-stellar core, Class 0 protostar, Class I protostar, and
protoplanetary disk. Comparing high spectral resolution (R 1500-3000)
and sensitivity (S/N 100-300) observations from 3 to 15 um to template
spectra, we will map the spatial distribution of ices down to 20-50 AU
in these targets to identify when, and at what visual extinction, the
formation of each ice species begins. Such high-resolution spectra will
allow us to search for new COMs, as well as distinguish between
different ice morphologies,thermal histories, and mixing environments.
The analysis of these data will result in science products beneficial to
Cycle 2 proposers. A newly updated public laboratory ice database will
provide feature identifications for all of the expected ices, while a
chemical model fit to the observed ice abundances will be released
publically as a grid, with varied metallicity and UV fields to simulate
other environments. We will create improved algorithms to extract NIRCAM
WFSS spectra in crowded fields with extended sources as well as optimize
the defringing of MIRI LRS spectra in order to recover broad spectral
features. We anticipate that these resources will be particularly useful
for astrochemistry and spectroscopy of fainter, extended targets like
star forming regions of the SMC/LMC or more distant galaxies.

%B M dwarf stars are promising targets in the search for extrasolar
habitable planets, as their small size and close-in habitable zones make
the detection of Earth-analog planets easier than at Solar-type stars.
However, the effects of the high stellar activity of M dwarf hosts has
uncertain effects on such planets, and may render them uninhabitable.
Studying stellar activity at M dwarfs is hindered by a lack of
measurements of high-energy radiation, flare activity and, in
particular, stellar wind rates. We propose to rectify this by observing
a sample of Post Common Envelope Binaries (PCEBs) with HST and XMM-
Newton. PCEBs consist of an M dwarf with a white dwarf companion, which
experiences the same stellar wind and radiation environment as a close-
in planet. The stellar wind of the M dwarf accretes onto the otherwise
pure hydrogen atmosphere white dwarf, producing metal lines detectable
with ultraviolet spectroscopy. The metal lines can be used to measure
accretion rates onto the white dwarf, from with we can accurately infer
the stellar wind mass loss rate of the M dwarf, along with abundances of
key elements. Simultaneous observations with XMM-Newton will probe X-ray
flare occurrence rate and strength, in addition to coronal temperatures.
Performing these measurements over twelve PCEBs will provide a sample of
M dwarf stellar wind strengths, flare occurrence and X-ray/UV activity
that will finally shed light on the true habitability of planets around
small stars.

%B DMATIS (Dark Matter ATtenuation Importance Sampling) calculates the
trajectories of DM particles that propagate in the Earth's crust and the
lead shield to reach the DAMIC detector using an importance sampling
Monte-Carlo simulation. A detailed Monte-Carlo simulation avoids the
deficiencies of the SGED/KS method that uses a mean energy loss
description to calculate the lower bound on the DM-proton cross section.
The code implementing the importance sampling technique makes the brute-
force Monte-Carlo simulation of moderately strongly interacting DM with
nucleons computationally feasible. DMATIS is written in Python 3 and
MATHEMATICA.

%B In 2016 we saw the first direct detections of gravitational waves by
Advanced LIGO and the positive results from LISA Pathfinder. In this
context, NASA has decided to partner with the ESA on their L3
gravitational wave observatory, whose science goals are outlined in the
white paper, The Gravitational Universe. The current launch date for L3
is 2034, but with the success of Pathfinder and the increased scientific
interest in gravitational waves caused by LIGO, ESA and its member
states are exploring ways to move up the launch date. In the U.S., the
National Academy's Astronomy Midterm Assessment has recommended that
NASA restore support for a gravitational wave mission in this decade
with the goal of realizing the full scientific capability of the mission
envisioned in the 2020 decadal. NASA has appointed the L3 Study Team,
charged with providing analysis of potential U.S. contributions to the
European-led L3 mission and preparing for the next decadal survey. The
LISA mission concept, proposed for L3, will improve our understanding of
the formation and growth of massive black holes, create a census of
compact binary systems in the Milky Way, test general relativity in
extreme conditions, provide predictions of black hole binary mergers in
the LIGO frequency band, and enable searches for new physics.

%B Modern data analysis methods such as photometric ubercalibration and
optimized mosaicing with background matching have enhanced the public
products of many large astronomical surveys, but unfortunately not yet
for the GALEX mission. This is significant because GALEX provided our
only view of the entire ultraviolet (UV) sky - a circumstance unlikely
to change for many years. We have recently achieved both these
calibration goals for a subset of the GALEX observations toward the
Magellanic Clouds, substantially increasing the quality and internal
consistency of the source catalogs and fidelity of the diffuse emission
morphology in this limited region. We propose to apply the same methods
to the entire public GALEX database, in order to eliminate remaining
discontinuities in the current photometry and step-like background
artifacts in sky maps. This work will have two principal products: (1)
the updated photometric catalog for all GALEX sources, and (2) a Legacy
all-sky coadd for both the FUV and NUV bands. Traditional GALEX pipeline
analysis only stacked exposures that were obtained as part of the same
planned survey tile. However, a substantial degree of overlap between
independent GALEX observations does exist and can used to produce a
deeper coadd over much of the sky. Redundant coverage also allows
artifacts such as internal reflections to be masked when stacking. Our
ADAP effort will ideally complement the all-sky unWISE reprocessing
project in infrared bands. We will publicly release all products as they
are produced. This project will positively impact both extragalactic and
Milky Way related science and is therefore relevant to a wide range of
NASA priorities.

%B The SkyMapper Early Data Release (EDR) is the initial data release from
the SkyMapper Southern Survey, which aims to create a deep, multi-epoch,
multi-band photometric data set for the entire southern sky. EDR covers
approximately 6700 sq. deg. (one-third) of the southern sky as obtained
by the Short Survey component of the project. All included fields have
at least two visits in good conditions in all six SkyMapper filters
(uvgriz). Object catalogues are complete to magnitude 17-18, depending
on filter. IVOA-complaint table access protocol (TAP), cone search and
simple image access protocol (SIAP) services are available from the
SkyMapper website (http://skymapper.anu.edu.au/), as well as through
tools such as TOPCAT. Data are restricted to Australian astronomers and
their collaborators for twelve months from the release date. Further
details on the reduction of SkyMapper data, along with data quality
improvements, will be released in late 2016 as part of SkyMapper Data
Release 1 (DR1).

%B Fiber optic networks are no longer just pipelines for transporting data
in the long haul backbone. Exponential growth in traffic in metro-
regional areas has pushed higher capacity fiber toward the edge of the
network, and highly dynamic patterns of heterogeneous traffic have
emerged that are often bursty, severely stressing the historical "fat
and dumb pipe" static optical network, which would need to be massively
over-provisioned to deal with these loads. What is required is a more
intelligent network with a span of control over the optical as well as
electrical transport mechanisms which enables handling of service
requests in a fast and efficient way that guarantees quality of service
(QoS) while optimizing capacity efficiency. An "agile" optical network
is a reconfigurable optical network comprised of high speed intelligent
control system fed by real-time in situ network sensing. It provides
fast response in the control and switching of optical signals in
response to changing traffic demands and network conditions. This agile
control of optical signals is enabled by pushing switching decisions
downward in the network stack to the physical layer. Implementing such
agility is challenging due to the response dynamics and interactions of
signals in the physical layer. Control schemes must deal with issues
such as dynamic power equalization, EDFA transients and cascaded noise
effects, impairments due to self-phase modulation and dispersion, and
channel-to-channel cross talk. If these issues are not properly
predicted and mitigated, attempts at dynamic control can drive the
optical network into an unstable state. In order to enable high speed
actuation of signal modulators and switches, the network controller must
be able to make decisions based on predictive models. In this thesis, we
consider how to take advantage of Software Defined Networking (SDN)
capabilities for network reconfiguration, combined with embedded models
that access updates from deployed network monitoring sensors. In order
to maintain signal quality while optimizing network resources, we find
that it is essential to model and update estimates of the physical link
impairments in real-time. In this thesis, we consider the key elements
required to enable an agile optical network, with contributions as
follows: ∙ Control Framework: extended the SDN concept to include the
optical transport network through extensions to the OpenFlow (OF)
protocol. A unified SDN control plane is built to facilitate control and
management capability across the electrical/packet-switched and optical
/circuit-switched portions of the network seamlessly. The SDN control
plane serves as a platform to abstract the resources of
multilayer/multivendor networks. Through this platform, applications can
dynamically request the network resources to meet their service
requirements. ∙ Use of In-situ Monitors: enabled real-time physical
impairment sensing in the control plane using in-situ Optical
Performance Monitoring (OPM) and bit error rate (BER) analyzers. OPM and
BER values are used as quantitative indicators of the link status and
are fed to the control plane through a high-speed data collection
interface to form a closed-loop feedback system to enable adaptive
resource allocation. ∙ Predictive Network Model: used a network model
embedded in the control layer to study the link status. The estimated
results of network status is fed into the control decisions to
precompute the network resources. The performance of the network model
can be enhanced by the sensing results. ∙ Real-Time Control Algorithms:
investigated various dynamic resource allocation mechanisms supporting
an agile optical network. Intelligent routing and wavelength switching
for recovering from traffic impairments is achieved experimentally in
the agile optical network within one second. A distance-adaptive
spectrum allocation scheme to address transmission impairments caused by
cascaded Wavelength Selective Switches (WSS) is proposed and evaluated
for improving network spectral efficiency.

%B Coronal holes are where the fast solar wind streams out of the Suns
atmosphere, sending charged particles on rapid trajectories out into the
solar system. A new study examines how the distribution of coronal holes
has changed over the last 40 years.Coronal holes form where magnetic
field lines open into space (B) instead of looping back to the solar
surface (A). [Sebman81]Source of the Fast Solar WindAs a part of the
Suns natural activity cycle, extremely low-density regions sometimes
form in the solar corona. These coronal holes manifest themselves as
dark patches in X-ray and extreme ultraviolet imaging, since the corona
is much hotter than the solar surface that peeks through from underneath
it.Coronal holes form when magnetic field lines open into space instead
of looping back to the solar surface. In these regions, the solar
atmosphere escapes via these field lines, rapidly streaming away from
the Suns surface in whats known as the fast solar wind.Coronal Holes
Over Space and TimeAutomated detection of coronal holes from image-based
analysis is notoriously difficult. Recently, a team of scientists led by
Kenichi Fujiki (ISEE, Nagoya University, Japan) has developed an
automated prediction technique for coronal holes that relies instead on
magnetic-field data for the Sun, obtained at the National Solar
Observatorys Kitt Peak between 1975 and 2014. The team used these data
to produce a database of 3335 coronal hole predictions over nearly 40
years.Latitude distribution of 2870 coronal holes (each marked by an x;
color indicates polarity), overlaid on the magnetic butterfly map of the
Sun. The low-latitude coronal holes display a similar butterfly pattern,
in which they move closer to the equator over the course of the solar
cycle. Polar coronal holes are more frequent during solar minima.
[Fujiki et al. 2016]Examining trends in the coronal holes distribution
in latitude and time, Fujiki and collaborators find a strong correlation
between the total area covered by low-latitude coronal holes (holes
closer to the Suns equator) and sunspot activity. In contrast, the total
area of high-latitude coronal holes (those near the Suns poles) peaks
around the minimum in each solar cycle and shrinks around each solar
maximum.Predicting the Impact of the Solar WindWhy do these observations
matter? Coronal holes are the source of the fast solar wind, so if we
can better predict the frequency and locations of coronal holes in the
future, we can make better predictions about how the solar wind might
impact us here on Earth.Periodicity of high-latitude (orange) and low-
latitude (blue) coronal-hole areas, and periodicity of galactic cosmic
rays detected at Earth (black). The cosmic rays track the polar coronal-
hole area behavior with a 1-year time lag. [Fujiki et al. 2016]In one
example of this, Fujiki and collaborators show that theres a distinct
correlation between polar coronal-hole area and observed galactic cosmic
rays. Cosmic rays from within our galaxy have long been known to exhibit
a 22-year periodicity. Fujiki and collaborators show that the
periodicity of the galactic cosmic-ray activity tracks that of the polar
coronal-hole area, with a ~1-year lag time which is equivalent to the
propagation time of the solar wind to the termination shock.Polar
coronal holes are therefore a useful observable indicator of the dipole
component of the solar magnetic field, which modulates the incoming
cosmic rays entering our solar system. This coronal hole database will
be a useful tool for understanding the source of solar wind and the many
ways the wind influences the Earth and our solar system.CitationK.

%B A systematic inspection of the far-infrared (FIR) properties of evolved
stars allows not only to constrain physical models, but also to
understand the chemical evolution that takes place in the end of their
lives. In this work we intend to study the circumstellar envelopes (CSE)
on a sample of stars in the THROES catalogue from AGB/post-AGB stars to
planetary nebulae using photometry and spectroscopy provided by the PACS
instrument on-board Herschel telescope. In the first part we are
interested in obtaining an estimate of the size of FIR emitting region
and to sort our targets in two classes: point-like and extended.
Secondly, we focus on the molecular component of the envelope traced by
carbon monoxide (CO) rotational lines. We conduct a line survey on a
sample of evolved stars by identifying and measuring flux of both 12CO
and 13CO isotopologues in the PACS range, while looking at the overall
properties of the sample. Lastly, we will be interested in obtaining
physical parameters of the CSE, namely gas temperature, mass and mass-
loss rate on a sample of carbon stars. For that, we make use of PACS
large wavelength coverage, which enables the simultaneous study of a
large number of CO transitions, to perform the rotational diagram
analysis. We report the detection of CO emission in a high number of
stars from the catalogue, which were mostly classified as point-like
targets with a few exceptions of planetary nebulae. High J rotational
number transitions were detected in a number of targets, revealing the
presence of a significant amount of hot gas (T ̃ 400-900 K) and high
mass-loss rates. We conclude that Herschel/PACS is in a privileged
position to detect a new population of warmer gas, typically missed in
sub-mm/mm observations.

%B PyPHER (Python-based PSF Homogenization kERnels) computes an
homogenization kernel between two PSFs; the code is well-suited for PSF
matching applications in both an astronomical or microscopy context. It
can warp (rotation + resampling) the PSF images (if necessary), filter
images in Fourier space using a regularized Wiener filter, and produce a
homogenization kernel. PyPHER requires the pixel scale information to be
present in the FITS files, which can if necessary be added by using the
provided ADDPIXSCL method.

%B A multiwavelength (radio and optical) observing campaign on SS Cyg is
underway, and AAVSO participation is urgently requested. An AAVSO Alert
Notice will be issued February 5 with full details. The purpose of this
Special Notice is to alert observers right now to the need to monitor SS
Cyg very closely and report your observations to the AAVSO via WebObs at
once. It is likely to go into outburst very soon, and immediate
reporting of outburst behavior is crucial to the success of the
campaign. Previous similar campaigns with Dr. James Miller-Jones and his
colleagues have been very successful. AAVSO observations are used to
trigger multi-site radio observations of SS Cyg in research on radio
emission from this dwarf nova, as well as for correlation with the radio
data during analysis. Visual and CCD/DSLR (particularly V) observations
are requested (no time series unless outburst is underway and radio
observations have been triggered). Its normal minimum magnitude is 11.8
V, but it can fluctuate to around 11.5. If it becomes brighter than 11.5
V, it could well be going into outburst. If it reaches 11.0, it is
almost certainly on its way up. Please report your observations of SS
Cyg to the AAVSO as soon after you make them as possible. If you see it
11.5 or brighter, please report them immediately. Finder charts with
sequence may be created using the AAVSO Variable Star Plotter
(https://www.aavso.org/vsp). Observations should be submitted to the
AAVSO International Database. See full Special Notice for more details.

%B Two research endeavors are described in this dissertation; both
undertake problems in solid-state astrophysics, which is a branch of
solid-state physics concerning the extreme conditions found within white
dwarfs and the solid crusts of neutron stars. As much of our knowledge
about these compact objects comes from observation of astrophysical
phenomena, Chapter 1 is devoted to the phenomena, and how they can be
exploited as material property probes. Several of the most interesting
phenomena involve the enormous magnetic fields (B ≥ 1012 gauss) harbored
by many neutron stars, and the interaction between these fields and the
charged particles within the solid crust. Accordingly, Chapter 2 reviews
some theory of strongly-magnetized electrons, which both sets the stage
for Chapter 3, and (hopefully) serves as a useful reference for future
research. Let it now be made clear that this dissertation focuses
exclusively on the "outer crusts," of neutron stars, where no free
neutrons are present (rho < 4x1011 g/cc), and the similarly-composed
interiors of white dwarfs, which have central densities ̃ 107 g/cc. For
the most part we specialize to even lower densities. In Chapter 3,
static and dynamic properties of low density (rho ≥ 106 g/cc) outer
envelopes of neutron stars are calculated within the nonlinear magnetic
Thomas-Fermi model, assuming degenerate electrons. A novel domain
decomposition enables proper description of lattice symmetry and may be
seen as a prototype for the general class of problems involving
nonlinear charge screening of periodic, quasi-low-dimensionality
structures, e.g. liquid crystals. We describe a scalable implementation
of the method using Hypre. Over the density range considered, the
effective shear modulus appears to be a factor of ≈ 20 larger than in
the linearlyscreened Coulomb crystal model, which could have
implications for observables related to astroseismology as well as low
temperature phonon-mediated thermal conductivity. Other findings include
incipient c' < 0 elastic instabilities for both bcc and fcc lattices,
reminiscent of the situation in some light actinides, and suggestive of
a symmetry-lowering transition to a tetragonal or orthorhombic lattice.
Chapter 4 describes a systematic search for multicomponent crystal
structures, carried out for five different ternary systems of nuclei in
a polarizable background of electrons, representative of accreted
neutron star crusts and some white dwarfs. Candidate structures are
"bred" by a genetic algorithm, and optimized at constant pressure under
the assumption of linear response (Thomas-Fermi) charge screening.
Subsequent phase equilibria calculations reveal eight distinct crystal
structures in the T = 0 bulk phase diagrams, five of which are
complicated multinary structures not before predicted in the context of
compact object astrophysics. Frequent instances of geometrically similar
but compositionally distinct phases give insight into structural
preferences of systems with pairwise Yukawa interactions, including and
extending to the regime of low density colloidal suspensions made in a
laboratory. As an application of these main results, we self-
consistently couple the phase stability problem to the equations for a
self-gravitating, hydrostatically stable white dwarf, with fixed overall
composition. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to incorporate
complex multinary phases into the equilibrium phase layering diagram and
mass-radius-composition dependence, both of which are reported for
He-C-O and C-O-Ne white dwarfs. Finite thickness interfacial phases
("interphases") show up at the boundaries between single-component bcc
crystalline regions, some of which have lower lattice symmetry than
cubic. A second application---quasi-static settling of heavy nuclei in
white dwarfs---builds on our equilibrium phase layering method. Tests of
this nonequilibrium method reveal extra phases which play the role of
transient host phases for the settling species.

%B Did you know that the very first exoplanets ever confirmed were found
around a pulsar? The precise timing measurements of pulsar PSR 1257+12
were what made the discovery of its planetary companions possible. Yet
surprisingly, though weve discovered thousands of exoplanets since then,
only one other planet has ever been confirmed around a pulsar. Now, a
team of CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science researchers are trying to
figure out why.Formation ChallengesThe lack of detected pulsar planets
may simply reflect the fact that getting a pulsar-planet system is
challenging! There are three main pathways:The planet formed before the
host star became a pulsar which means it somehow survived its star going
supernova (yikes!).The planet formed elsewhere and was captured by the
pulsar.The planet formed out of the debris of the supernova
explosion.The first two options, if even possible, are likely to be rare
occurrences but the third option shows some promise. In this scenario,
after the supernova explosion, a small fraction of the material falls
back toward the stellar remnant and is recaptured, forming what is known
as a supernova fallback disk. According to this model, planets could
potentially form out of this disk.Disk ImplicationsLed by Matthew Kerr,
the CSIRO astronomers set out to systematically look for these potential
planets that might have formed in situ around pulsars. They searched a
sample of 151 young, energetic pulsars, scouring seven years of pulse
time-of-arrival data for periodic variation that could signal the
presence of planetary companions. Their methods to mitigate pulsar
timing noise and model realistic orbits allowed them to have good
sensitivity to low-mass planets.The results? They found no conclusive
evidence that any of these pulsars have planets.This outcome carries
with it some significant implications. The pulsar sample spans 2 Myr in
age, in which planets should have had enough time to form in debris
disks. The fact that none were detected suggests that long-lived
supernova fallback disks may actually be much rarer than thought, or
they exist only in conditions that arent compatible with planet
formation.So if thats the case, what about the planets found around PSR
1257+12? This pulsar may actually be somewhat unique, in that it was
born with an unusually weak magnetic field. This birth defect might have
allowed it to form a fallback disk and, subsequently, planets where the
sample of energetic pulsars studied here could not.CitationM. Kerr et

%B The ability to detect small and localized movements of geotechnical
facilities is important for performance monitoring and early-warning
hazard detection. Current deformation monitoring technology is limited
in its ability to both scan massive structures and detect small and
localized movements. Ground-based interferometric radar (GBIR) is an
emerging remote sensing technology that has the potential to fill this
gap in surface deformation monitoring technology. Much of the focus of
previous research and application of GBIR has been on monitoring large
spatial scale movements, such as mine walls, dams, and earth slopes
experiencing deformational movements occurring over hundreds or
thousands of square meters. In this study the focus is on evaluating the
capabilities of GBIR for detecting and monitoring small movements (mm-
scale) occurring over very localized regions (a few m2). Specifically,
this study focused on the application of GBIR for detecting and
monitoring movements of individual boulders in a massive landscape. The
potential long-term application is to use GBIR to detect and monitor
precursor movements to rockfall events. Boulders, ranging from 0.5 to 5
meters in approximate facial dimensions, were moved using pry bars and
airbag jacks in increments of a few to several mm. Two identical GBIR
devices positioned at separate locations scanned a region covering
approximately 20,000 m2 after each boulder movement. Ground truth
measurements were also performed after each boulder movement. The
detectability of the boulder movements was assessed by comparing the
distribution of measured phase values from the boulder to (1) phase
values measured on the surrounding non-moving portion of the image and
(2) phase values measured from the same boulder when it was not moving.
The results from the study showed that movements of boulders with
dimensions larger than about 2 m were detectable for range offset
distances from about 75 to 150 m. Movements as small of 1.7 mm were
detected on these larger boulders. Phase values associated with
movements of the smaller boulders, with dimensions less than about 2 m,
were more difficult to differentiate from the non-moving portions of the
image. This study successfully demonstrated the potential of GBIR to
fill existing gaps in current displacement and deformation monitoring
technology for geotechnical applications.

%B Recent works show that the restframe colours of X-ray selected AGN host
galaxies at z~1 are no different from those of inactive galaxies once
stellar mass selection effects are taken into account. However, there is
a clear deficit of AGN among quiescent galaxies, and the average star
formation rates of AGN hosts are comparable or higher than those of
inactive star-forming galaxies. These apparently contradictory findings
could be a consequence of higher extinction in star-forming AGN hosts
compensating for their younger stellar populations in observed colours.
In this talk I will present a new method of extinction correction that
breaks the degeneracy with stellar age and metallicity by comparing the
restframe U-V colour with measurements of the Dn(4000) index on
intermediate band photospectra from SHARDS. I'll show that the
distribution of extinction corrected U-V colours and Dn(4000) for AGN
hosts at z<1 is significantly different from that of comparison samples
of inactive galaxies, with a clear deficit of AGN in intrinsic red
galaxies and a higher prevalence among those with intermediate age
stellar populations.

%B SUPERBOX is a particle-mesh code that uses moving sub-grids to track and
resolve high-density peaks in the particle distribution and a nearest
grid point force-calculation scheme based on the second derivatives of
the potential. The code implements a fast low-storage FFT-algorithm and
allows a highly resolved treatment of interactions in clusters of
galaxies, such as high-velocity encounters between elliptical galaxies
and the tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies, as sub-grids follow the
trajectories of individual galaxies. SUPERBOX is efficient in that the
computational overhead is kept as slim as possible and is also memory
efficient since it uses only one set of grids to treat galaxies in
succession.

%B The Low Frequency All Sky Monitor (LoFASM) is a distributed array of
dipole antennas that are sensitive to radio frequencies from 10 to 88
MHz. The primary science goals of LoFASM are the detection and study of
low-frequency radio transients, a high priority science goal as deemed
by the National Research Council's decadal survey. LoFASM consists of
antennas and front-end electronics that were originally developed for
the Long Wavelength Array (LWA) by the U.S. Naval Research Lab, the
University of New Mexico, Virginia Tech, and the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory. LoFASM, funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, will
initially consist of four stations, each consisting of 12 dual-
polarization dipole antennas. In a single station, RF signals from each
of the individual LoFASM dipoles are combined in phase in order to
synthesize LoFASM's beam. The LoFASM RF signals are phased up so that
the resulting beam is sensitive to radio emission that originates from
the zenith and RF signals approaching from the horizon are attenuated.
Digitally, this is achieved using a full Stokes 100MHz correlating
spectrometer constructed using field programmable gate array (FPGA)
technology. In this thesis I will describe the design and usage of the
LoFASM Correlator.

%X Accurate flux calibration for the STIS echelle modes is heavily
dependent on the proper alignment of the blaze function for each
spectral order. However, due to changes in the instrument alignment over
time and between exposures, the blaze function can shift in wavelength.
This may result in flux calibration inconsistencies of up to 10%. We
present the stisblazefix Python module as a tool for STIS users to
correct their echelle spectra. The stisblazefix module assumes that the
error in the blaze alignment is a linear function of spectral order, and
finds the set of shifts that minimizes the flux inconsistencies in the
overlap between spectral orders. We discuss the uses and limitations of
this tool, and show that its use can provide significant improvements to
the default pipeline flux calibration for many observations.

%X The fluxes of <SUP>3</SUP>He, <SUP>4</SUP>He, C, O, and Fe ions at low
energies (about 0.04 - 2 MeV/nucleon) are studied during quiet periods
in Solar Cycles (SC) 23 and 24 using data from the ULEIS/ACE instrument.
In selecting quiet periods (the definition is given in Section 2.1),
additional data from EPHIN/SOHO and EPAM/ACE were also used. The
analysis of the ion energy spectra and their relative abundances shows
that their behavior is governed by their first-ionization potential.
Substantial differences in the ion energy spectra in two consecutive
solar cycles are observed during the quiet periods selected. Quiet-time
fluxes are divided into three distinct types according to the {̃} 80 -
320 keV/nucleon Fe/O ratio. Our results confirm the earlier observation
that these types of suprathermal particles have different origins, that
is, they represent different seed populations that are accelerated by
different processes. Except for the solar activity minimum, the Fe/O
ratio during quiet-time periods correspond either to the abundances of
ions in particle fluxes accelerated in impulsive solar flares or to the
mean abundances of elements in the solar corona. At the activity
minimum, this ratio takes on values that are characteristic for the
solar wind. These results indicate that the background fluxes of low-
energy particles in the ascending, maximum, and decay phases of the
solar cycle include significant contributions from both coronal
particles accelerated to suprathermal energies and ions accelerated in
small impulsive solar flares rich in Fe, while the contribution of
remnants from earlier SEP events cannot be excluded. The comparison of
suprathermal ion abundances during the first five years of SC 23 and SC
24 suggests that the quiet-time and non-quiet fluxes of Fe and
<SUP>3</SUP>He were lower in SC 24.

spectroscopic binary stars identified by the Geneva-Copenhagen
spectroscopic survey with the SOAR 4m telescope + HRCam. These systems
represent our best chance to take advantage of Gaia parallaxes for the
purpose of stellar mass determinations. Many of these systems already
have mass fractions (although generally no spectroscopic orbit - an
astrometric orbit will determine individual masses), metallicity
information, and Hipparcos distances. They will be used to improve our
knowledge of the mass-luminosity relation, particularly for lower-
metallicity stars. Our survey will create the first all-sky, volume-
limited, speckle archive for the two primary samples, complementing a
similar effort that has been recently been completed at the WIYN 3.5-m
telescope in the Northern Hemisphere. This extension to the Southern
Hemisphere will fill out the picture for a wider metallicity range.

%X Due to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration and its effect on global
climates, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
proposes a Clean Power Plan (CPP) mandating CO2 reductions which will
likely force the early retirement of inefficient, aging power plants.
Consequentially, removing these plants equates to a shortfall of
approximately 66 GW of electricity. These factors add to the looming
resource problems of choosing whether to build large replacement power
plants or consider alternative energy sources as a means to help close
the gap between electricity supply and demand in a given region. One
energy source, shallow water tidal currents, represents opportunities to
convert kinetic energy to mechanical forms and provide electricity to
homes and businesses. Nearly 2,000 National Oceanic Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) tidal current data points from Maine to Texas are
considered. This paper, based on systems engineering thinking, provides
key attributes (e.g. turbine efficiency, array size, transmission
losses) for consideration as decision makers seek to identify where to
site Marine Hydrokinetic (MHK) systems and the number of homes powered
by the practical harvest of electricity from tidal currents at those
locations with given attributes. A systems engineering process model is
proposed for consideration as is a regression based equation to estimate
MHK machine parameters needed for power a given number of homes.

The new deep VLA data totaling 26 hours of observations provides a
detailed look at the complex structure within the Toothbrush relic,
revealing enigmatic filaments and twists (see below). This new data will
help us to explore the possible merger history of this cluster, which is
theorized to have caused the unusual shapes we see today. For more

%X The observed evolution of the broad-band spectral energy distribution
(SED) in NS X-ray Nova Aql X-1 during the rise phase of a bright Fast-
Rise-Exponential-Decay-type outburst in 2013 can be understood in the
framework of thermal emission from non-stationary accretion disc with
radial temperature distribution transforming from a single-temperature
blackbody emitting ring into the multicolour irradiated accretion disc.
SED evolution during the hard to soft X-ray state transition looks
unusual, as it cannot be reproduced by the standard disc irradiation
model with a single irradiation parameter for NUV, Optical and NIR
spectral bands. NIR (NUV) band is correlated with soft (hard) X-ray flux
changes during the state transition interval, respectively. In our
interpretation, at the moment of X-ray state transition UV-emitting
parts of the accretion disc are screened from direct X-ray illumination
from the central source and are heated primarily by hard X-rays (E > 10
keV), scattered in the hot corona or wind possibly formed above the
optically thick outer accretion flow; the outer edge of multicolour
disc, which emits in Optical-NIR, can be heated primarily by direct
X-ray illumination. We point out that future simultaneous
multiwavelength observations of X-ray Nova systems during the fast X-ray
state transition interval are of great importance, as it can serve as
'X-ray tomograph' to study physical conditions in outer regions of
accretion flow. This can provide an effective tool to directly test the
energy-dependent X-ray heating efficiency, vertical structure and
accretion flow geometry in transient low-mass X-ray binaries.

%X The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover carries a suite of
meteorological detectors that constitute the Rover Environmental
Monitoring Station (REMS) instrument. REMS investigates the
meteorological conditions at Gale crater by obtaining high-frequency
data of pressure, air and ground temperature, relative humidity, UV flux
at the surface and wind intensity and direction with some limitations in
the wind data. We have run a search of atmospheric pressure drops of
short duration (< 25 s) and we present a statistical study of the
frequency of these events in the REMS pressure data during its first
1417 sols (more than two Martian years). The identified daytime pressure
drops could be caused by the close passages of warm vortices and dust
devils. Previous systematic searches of warm vortices from REMS pressure
data (Kahanpää et al., 2016; Steakley and Murphy, 2016) cover about one
Martian year. We show that sudden pressure drops are twice more abundant
in the second Martian year [sols 671-1339] than in the first one
analyzed in previous works. The higher number of detections could be
linked to a combination of different topography, higher altitudes (120 m
above the landing site) and true inter-annual meteorological
variability. We found 1129 events with a pressure drop larger than 0.5
Pa. Of these, 635 occurred during the local daytime (∼56%) and 494 were
nocturnal. The most intense pressure drop (4.2 Pa) occurred at daytime
on sol 1417 (areocentric solar longitude L<SUB>s</SUB> = 195°) and was
accompanied by a simultaneous decrease in the UV signal of 7.1%,
pointing to a true dust devil. We also discuss similar but less intense
simultaneous pressure and UV radiation drops that constitute 0.7% of all
daytime events. Most of the intense daytime pressure drops with
variations larger than 1.0 Pa occur when the difference between air and
ground temperature is larger than 15 K. Statistically, the frequency of
daytime pressure drops peaks close to noon (12:00-13:00 Local True Solar
Time or LTST) with more events in spring and summer (L<SUB>s</SUB> from
180° to 360°). The nocturnal sudden pressure drops concentrate in the
20:00-23:00 LTST time interval and they only occur in spring and summer.
We interpret these nocturnal events as a consequence of local
mechanically forced turbulence. This interpretation is consistent with
published results from simulations with the MRAMS model (Rafkin et al.,
2016) that predict a competition between local orographic circulation
and global Hadley cell circulation at Gale crater at summer night-time
that can enhance forced turbulence at the surface. Bursts of pressure
drops appear on particular sols, especially at night-time. Most of the
vortex bursts occurred when MSL was in the region called Pahrump Hills
characterized by a complex terrain. A comparison of the daytime pressure
drops from REMS data with published results from the Pathfinder and
Phoenix missions shows that the frequency of daytime events at Gale
crater in spring and summer is similar to the one previously found at
other locations. Finally, we present possible correlations between MSL
activity and some daytime pressure drops. If such an instrumental effect
is present in the REMS data its impact in this analysis is small and
would only affect about 7% of our detections.

model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ is a finitary factor of a finite-valued i.i.d.
process. We strengthen this by showing that the factor map can be made
to have finite expected coding volume (in fact, stretch-exponential
tails), answering a question of van den Berg and Steif. The result holds
at any temperature above the critical temperature. An analogous result
holds for Markov random fields satisfying a high-noise assumption and
for proper colorings with a large number of colors.

%X This work is the first study on the 3D shape of starbursting extremely
metal-poor galaxies (XMPs; a galaxy is said to be an XMP if its ionized
gas-phase metallicity is less than 1/10 the solar value). A few hundred
XMPs have been identified in the local universe primarily through mining
the spectroscopic catalog of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and
follow-up observations have shown that metallicity drops significantly
at the starburst (compared to the quiescent component of the galaxy). As
the timescale for gas mixing is short, the metal-poor gas triggering the
starburst must have been accreted recently. This is strong observational
evidence for the cold flow accretion predicted by cosmological models of
galaxy formation, and, in this respect, XMPs seem to be the best local
analogs of the very first galaxies.The ellipsoidal shape of a class of
galaxies can be inferred from the observed axial ratio (q) distribution
(q = minor axis/major axis) of a large sample of randomly-oriented
galaxies. Fitting ellipses to 200 XMPs using r-band SDSS images, we
observe that the axial ratio distribution falls off at q < ~0.4 and q >
~0.8, and we determine that these falloffs are not due to biases in the
data. The falloff at low axial ratio indicates that the XMPs are thick
for their size, and the falloff at high axial ratio suggests the vast
majority of XMPs are triaxial. We also observe that smaller XMPs are
thicker in proportion to their size, and it is expected that for
decreasing galaxy size the ratio of random to rotational motions
increases, which correlates with increasing relative thickness. The XMPs
are low-redshift dwarf galaxies dominated by dark matter, and our
results are compatible with simulations that have shown dark matter
halos to be triaxial, with triaxial stellar distributions for low-mass
galaxies and with triaxiality increasing over time. We will offer
precise constraints on the 3D shape of XMPs via Bayesian analysis of our
observed axial ratio distribution.This work has been supported by the La
Caixa Foundation and the Estallidos Spanish Ministry of Science and
Innovation grant.

%X Studies in the last 10 years of dust formation in core-collapse
supernovae (CCSNe) have found only small amounts, 0.001 solar masses.
This is far less than the amount needed to account for the large masses
of dust seen in some high redshift galaxies. However, the recent
discovery of 1 solar mass of cold dust in the ejecta of SN 1987A has has
caused a complete re-evaluation of dust formation in CCSNe. It has been
suggested that the CCSNe are continuously forming dust so that by the
time they are about 25 years old they will have dust masses similar to
SN 1987A. However, there is a wide time gap between the CCSNe that have
been studied recently and SN 1987A. We plan to use the sensitivity of
Spitzer to detect dust emission from SN 2017eaw at two epochs less than
a year after explosion. Radiative transfer models will be used to
estimate the dust masses. These observations will provide a necessary
baseline for our proposed JWST DD ERS observations. This is part of a
long term study to look for evidence of continuous dust formation in
CCSNe. These observations will help shed light on the mystery of dust in
the early universe. SSC Note: A 2019 epoch was added by the TAC.

%X We investigate the scaling properties of EUV intensity fluctuations seen
in low-latitude coronal holes (CH) and in regions of Quiet Sun (QS), in
signals obtained with the SDO/AIA instrument in the 193 Å waveband.
Contemporaneous time series in the 171 and 211 Å wavebands are used for
comparison among emissions at different heights in the transition region
and low corona. Potential-field extrapolations of contemporaneous
SDO/HMI line-of-sight magnetic fields provide a context in the physical
environment. Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) shows that the
variance of the fluctuations obeys a power-law as a function of temporal
scales with periods in the range ~15-60 min. This scaling is
characterized by a generalized Hurst exponent α. In QS regions, and in
regions within CHs that include magnetic bipoles, the scaling exponent
lies in the range 1.0 < α < 1.5, and it thus corresponds to anti-
correlated, turbulent-like, dynamical processes. Regions inside the
coronal holes primarily associated with magnetic field of a dominant
single polarity, have a generalized exponent (0.5 < α < 1) corresponding
to positively correlated (“persistent”) processes. The results indicate
the influence of the magnetic fields on the dynamics of the emission.

%X Flares are thought to be sudden releases of magnetic energy stored
around starspots. Recent space high-precision photometry shows
“superflares”, 10-10<SUP>4</SUP> times more energetic than the largest
solar flares, occur on many G, K, M-type stars (e.g., Maehara+2012
Nature). Harmful UV/X-ray radiation and high-energy particles such as
protons are caused by such superflares. This may suggest that exoplanet
host stars have severe effects on the physical and chemical evolution of
exoplanetary atmospheres (cf. Segura+2010 Astrobiology, Takahashi+2016
ApJL).We here present statistical properties of superflares on G, K,
M-type stars on the basis of our analyses of Kepler photometric data
(Maehara+2012 Nature, Shibayama+2013 ApJS, Notsu+2013 ApJ,
Canderaresi+2014 ApJ, Maehara+2015 EPS, Maehara+2017 PASJ). We found
more than 5000 superflares on 800 G, K, M-type main-sequence stars, and
the occurrence frequency (dN/dE) of superflares as a function of flare
energy (E) shows the power-law distribution with the index of -1.8 -1.9.
This power-law distribution is consistent with that of solar
flares.Flare frequency increases as stellar temperature decreases. As
for M-type stars, energy of the largest flares is smaller compared with
G,K-type stars, but more frequent “hazardous” flares for the habitable
planets since the habitable zone around M-type stars is much smaller
compared with G, K-type stars.Rotation period and starspot coverage can
be estimated from the quasi-periodic brightness variation of the
superflare stars. The intensity of Ca II 8542 line of superflare stars,
which is measured from spectroscopic observations with Subaru Telescope,
has a well correlation with the brightness variation amplitude
(Notsu+2015a&b PASJ).Flare frequency has a correlation with rotation
period, and this suggests young rapidly-rotating stars (like “young
Sun”) have more severe impacts of flares on the planetary atmosphere
(cf. Airapetian+2016 ApJL). Flare energy and frequency also depends on
starspot coverage, and this suggests existence of large starspots is
important factor of superflares.These statistical properties of
superflares discussed here can be one of the basic information for
considering the impacts of flares on planet-host stars.

%X Different groups of meteorites have distinctive isotopic compositions.
In a 2011 paper, Paul Warren (University of California, Los Angeles)
showed that there is a clear dichotomy in chromium and titanium isotopic
compositions between carbonaceous chondrites and all the other types of
stony meteorites, plus Earth, Moon, and Mars. Thomas Kruijer (Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, California and University of Münster,
Germany) and colleagues at the University of Münster now show that the
dichotomy involves iron meteorites as well as rocky ones. The two
distinct groups were nicknamed the CC (those with isotopes like
carbonaceous chondrites) and NC (those with isotopes like non-
carbonaceous meteorites). Kruijer and colleagues were able to determine
the time of core formation in the planetesimals in which iron meteorites
formed and report that CC iron meteorites formed 2.2 to 2.8 million
years after CAI formation, whereas the NC iron meteorites formed
earlier, before 1.8 million years after CAIs. (CAIs, calcium-aluminum-
rich inclusions, are the first solids to form in the Solar System and
give us a time-zero reference marker.) The accretion of the
planetesimals preceded core formation. Thermal calculations done by
Kruijer and colleagues indicate that NC objects accreted at 0.4 million
years after CAIs. In contrast, the CC objects accreted at 0.9 million
years after CAIs. Kruijer and colleagues suggest on the basis of their
results and published models for the formation of Jupiter that the
dichotomy resulted from Jupiter's formation. The NC materials accreted
when there was a continuous gas disk characterized by solids flowing
inwards towards the Sun. However, less than a million years later,
something interrupted this continuous flow, leading to formation of the
isotopic dichotomy. Kruijer and coworkers suggest that rapid accretion
of Jupiter's solid, mostly rocky core was the event that disrupted the
continuous inwards flow. Models suggest that Jupiter would have grown to
about 20 Earth masses, after which it grew by accreting gases to it. The
ages of the NC and CC iron meteorite groups indicate that Jupiter's
rocky core formed about 1 million years after CAIs. Sophisticated models
for planetary accretion predict early formation of the rocky core of
Jupiter, but suggest this process took between 1 and 10 million years
(after CAIs). Quantitative meteorite data show that the time was around
a million years, providing useful input for improving the models and
showing the value of combining theory with data on ancient samples.

%X Fluctuations are one of the main probes of the physics of the new state
of hot and dense nuclear matter called the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP)
which is created in the ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. In this
dissertation we extend and improve upon the existing descriptions of
heavy ion collisions in three different directions: we study the new
signatures of initial state fluctuations, the propagation of
perturbations in the early stages of the collision, and the effect of
thermal fluctuations on the hydrodynamic expansion of the QGP. First, in
Chapter 3 we study initial state fluctuations by examining the complete
statistical information contained in the two-particle correlation
measurements in hydrodynamic simulations of Pb+Pb collisions at the CERN
Large Hadron Collider (√sNN = 2.76 TeV). We use Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) to decompose the spectrum of harmonic flow, v_n(p_T) for
n = 0-5, into dominant components. The leading component is identified
with the standard event plane vn(pT), while the subleading component
describes additional fluctuations in the two-particle correlation
function. We find good geometric predictors for the orientation and the
magnitude of the leading and the subleading flows. The subleading v 0,
v1, and v3 flow harmonics are shown to be a response to the radial
excitation of the corresponding eccentricity epsilonn. In contrast, for
v2 the subleading flow in peripheral collisions is dominated by the
nonlinear mixing between the leading elliptic flow and radial flow
fluctuations. Nonlinear mixing also plays a significant role in
generating subleading v4 and v 5 harmonics. The PCA gives a systematic
way of studying the full information of the two-particle correlation
matrix and identifying the subleading flows, which we show are
responsible for factorization breaking in hydrodynamics. Second, in
Chapter 4 we study the thermalization and hydrodynamization of
fluctuations at the early stages of heavy ion collisions. We use leading
order effective kinetic theory, accurate at weak coupling, to simulate
the pre-equilibrium evolution of transverse energy and flow
perturbations. For the short evolution we can use a linear response
theory to construct the pre-equilibrium Green functions. Then the
energy-momentum tensor at a time when hydrodynamics becomes applicable
can be expressed as a linear convolution of response functions with the
initial perturbations. We propose combining effective kinetic theory
with weak coupling initial state models, such as IP-Glasma, to model the
complete pre-thermal evolution from saturated nuclei to hydrodynamics in
a weak coupling framework. Last, in Chapter 5 we consider out-of-
equilibrium hydrodynamic fluctuations in the expanding QGP. We develop a
set of kinetic equations for a correlator of thermal fluctuations which
are equivalent to nonlinear hydrodynamics with noise. We first show that
the kinetic response precisely reproduces the one-loop renormalization
of the shear viscosity for a static fluid. We then use the hydro-kinetic
equations to analyze thermal fluctuations for a Bjorken expansion. The
steady state solution to the kinetic equations determine the coefficient
of the first fractional power of the gradient expansion (infinity 1/(tau
T)3/2), which was computed here for the first time. The formalism of
hydro-kinetic equations can be applied to more general background flows
and coupled to existing viscous hydrodynamic codes to incorporate the
physics of hydrodynamic fluctuations.

%X How do magnetic fields form and evolve in early galaxies? A new study
has provided some clever observations to help us answer this
question.The Puzzle of Growing FieldsDynamo theory is the primary model
describing how magnetic fields develop in galaxies. In this picture,
magnetic fields start out as weak seed fields that are small and
unordered. These fields then become ordered and amplified by large-scale
rotation and turbulence in galaxy disks and halos, eventually leading to
the magnetic fields we observe in galaxies today.Schematic showinghow to
indirectly measure protogalactic magnetic fields. The measured
polarization of a background quasar is altered by the fields in a
foreground protogalaxy. Click for a closer look! [Farnes et al.
2017/Adolf Schaller/STSCI/NRAO/AUI/NSF]To test this model, we need
observations of the magnetic fields in young protogalaxies.
Unfortunately, we dont have the sensitivity to be able to measure these
fields directly but a team of scientists led by Jamie Farnes (Radboud
University in the Netherlands) have come up with a creative
alternative.The key is to find early protogalaxies that absorb the light
of more distant background objects. If a protogalaxy lies between us and
a distant quasar, then magnetic fields of the protogalaxy if present
will affect the polarization measurements of the background
quasar.Observing Galactic Building BlocksTop: Redshift distribution for
the background quasars in the authors sample. Bottom: Redshift
distribution for the foreground protogalaxies the authors are exploring.
[Farnes et al. 2017]Farnes and collaborators examined two types of
foreground protogalaxies: Damped Lyman-Alpha Absorbers (DLAs) and Lyman
Limit Systems (LLSs). They obtained polarimetric data for a sample of
114 distant quasars with nothing in the foreground (the control sample),
19 quasars with DLAs in the foreground, and 27 quasars with LLSs in the
foreground. They then used statistical analysis techniques to draw
conclusions about the magnetic fields in the foreground
protogalaxies.Farnes and collaborators were unable to detect either
coherent or random magnetic fields in DLAs. LLSs, however, showed some
evidence of coherent magnetic fields and significant evidence of
incoherent magnetic fields. The observations show that the magnetized
gas in LLSs must be highly turbulent on a scale of 520 parsecs similar
to turbulence scales in the Milky Way.Support for DynamosWhat do these
observations imply? Both support the dynamo theory of magnetic field
growth in galaxies!Polarization fraction distributions (top) and their
logarithms (bottom) for sources with and without protogalaxies in the
foreground (pink for DLAs, blue for LLSs, and grey for no intervenor).
Statistical analysis reveals that the distribution for LLSs differs from
the control sample, indicating the presence of magnetized gas. [Adapted
from Farnes et al. 2017]The DLAs appear to consist of mostly non-
turbulent quiescent gas; no dynamo action is currently occurring in
these protogalaxies. The LLSs, on the other hand, appear to be growing
their random magnetic fields via a turbulent dynamo. Thefields have not
yet had enough time to become ordered like the fields of more evolved
galaxies, however.Farnes and collaborators data indicate that magnetic
fields are indeed being gradually built up in early galaxies by dynamos.
They also suggest that DLAs may represent an earlier galactic
evolutionary stage than LLSs, as DLAs havent yet had the time to develop
their magnetic fields to a detectable level.A future increase in sample
size will certainly help improve our understanding of the field
formation process. In the meantime, the data in this study provide the
first observational picture of magnetic field evolution in galaxies,
lending excellent support to theoretical models.CitationJ. S. Farnes et

%X Hurricane Bonnie (1998) was an unusually resilient hurricane that
maintained intensity in 12-16 ms-1 vertical wind shear and during an
eyewall replacement cycle from 23-25 August. This remarkable behavior
was examined using observations from flight-level data, microwave
imagery, radar, and dropsondes over the two-day period. The symmetric
and asymmetric aspects of Bonnie's eyewall replacement cycle were
documented and compared to eyewall replacement cycles in other
hurricanes. Similar to other observed eyewall replacement cycles, Bonnie
exhibited the development, strengthening, and dominance of a secondary
eyewall while a primary eyewall decayed. However, Bonnie's structure was
highly asymmetric due to strong 12-16 ms-1 vertical wind shear, in
contrast to the more symmetric structures observed in other hurricanes
undergoing eyewall replacement cycles. It is hypothesized that strong
shear preferentially forced convection downshear, which was able to
extend upshear and form a secondary eyewall through enhanced surface
fluxes upshear. The larger radius of maximum winds after the eyewall
replacement cycle completed might have aided Bonnie's resiliency in
shear by increasing the likelihood that diabatic heating would fall
inside the radius of maximum winds. These observations of Hurricane
Bonnie's ability to maintain intensity in spite of high shear and an
eyewall replacement cycle, both of which usually result in weakening,
provide a new direction from which to view the intensity change issue in
hurricanes.

%X Icy grain mantles are the main reservoir for volatile elements in star-
forming regions across the Universe, as well as the formation site of
pre-biotic complex organic molecules (COMs) seen in our Solar System. We
propose to trace the evolution of pristine and complex ice chemistry in
a representative low-mass star-forming region through observations of a:
pre-stellar core, Class 0 protostar, Class I protostar, and
protoplanetary disk. Comparing high spectral resolution (R 1500-3000)
and sensitivity (S/N 100-300) observations from 3 to 15 um to template
spectra, we will map the spatial distribution of ices down to 20-50 AU
in these targets to identify when, and at what visual extinction, the
formation of each ice species begins. Such high-resolution spectra will
allow us to search for new COMs, as well as distinguish between
different ice morphologies,thermal histories, and mixing environments.
The analysis of these data will result in science products beneficial to
Cycle 2 proposers. A newly updated public laboratory ice database will
provide feature identifications for all of the expected ices, while a
chemical model fit to the observed ice abundances will be released
publically as a grid, with varied metallicity and UV fields to simulate
other environments. We will create improved algorithms to extract NIRCAM
WFSS spectra in crowded fields with extended sources as well as optimize
the defringing of MIRI LRS spectra in order to recover broad spectral
features. We anticipate that these resources will be particularly useful
for astrochemistry and spectroscopy of fainter, extended targets like
star forming regions of the SMC/LMC or more distant galaxies.

%X M dwarf stars are promising targets in the search for extrasolar
habitable planets, as their small size and close-in habitable zones make
the detection of Earth-analog planets easier than at Solar-type stars.
However, the effects of the high stellar activity of M dwarf hosts has
uncertain effects on such planets, and may render them uninhabitable.
Studying stellar activity at M dwarfs is hindered by a lack of
measurements of high-energy radiation, flare activity and, in
particular, stellar wind rates. We propose to rectify this by observing
a sample of Post Common Envelope Binaries (PCEBs) with HST and XMM-
Newton. PCEBs consist of an M dwarf with a white dwarf companion, which
experiences the same stellar wind and radiation environment as a close-
in planet. The stellar wind of the M dwarf accretes onto the otherwise
pure hydrogen atmosphere white dwarf, producing metal lines detectable
with ultraviolet spectroscopy. The metal lines can be used to measure
accretion rates onto the white dwarf, from with we can accurately infer
the stellar wind mass loss rate of the M dwarf, along with abundances of
key elements. Simultaneous observations with XMM-Newton will probe X-ray
flare occurrence rate and strength, in addition to coronal temperatures.
Performing these measurements over twelve PCEBs will provide a sample of
M dwarf stellar wind strengths, flare occurrence and X-ray/UV activity
that will finally shed light on the true habitability of planets around
small stars.

%X DMATIS (Dark Matter ATtenuation Importance Sampling) calculates the
trajectories of DM particles that propagate in the Earth's crust and the
lead shield to reach the DAMIC detector using an importance sampling
Monte-Carlo simulation. A detailed Monte-Carlo simulation avoids the
deficiencies of the SGED/KS method that uses a mean energy loss
description to calculate the lower bound on the DM-proton cross section.
The code implementing the importance sampling technique makes the brute-

nucleons computationally feasible. DMATIS is written in Python 3 and

%X In 2016 we saw the first direct detections of gravitational waves by
Advanced LIGO and the positive results from LISA Pathfinder. In this
context, NASA has decided to partner with the ESA on their L3
gravitational wave observatory, whose science goals are outlined in the
white paper, The Gravitational Universe. The current launch date for L3
is 2034, but with the success of Pathfinder and the increased scientific
interest in gravitational waves caused by LIGO, ESA and its member
states are exploring ways to move up the launch date. In the U.S., the
National Academy's Astronomy Midterm Assessment has recommended that
NASA restore support for a gravitational wave mission in this decade
with the goal of realizing the full scientific capability of the mission
envisioned in the 2020 decadal. NASA has appointed the L3 Study Team,
charged with providing analysis of potential U.S. contributions to the
European-led L3 mission and preparing for the next decadal survey. The
LISA mission concept, proposed for L3, will improve our understanding of
the formation and growth of massive black holes, create a census of
compact binary systems in the Milky Way, test general relativity in
extreme conditions, provide predictions of black hole binary mergers in
the LIGO frequency band, and enable searches for new physics.

%X Modern data analysis methods such as photometric ubercalibration and
optimized mosaicing with background matching have enhanced the public
products of many large astronomical surveys, but unfortunately not yet
for the GALEX mission. This is significant because GALEX provided our
only view of the entire ultraviolet (UV) sky - a circumstance unlikely
to change for many years. We have recently achieved both these
calibration goals for a subset of the GALEX observations toward the
Magellanic Clouds, substantially increasing the quality and internal
consistency of the source catalogs and fidelity of the diffuse emission
morphology in this limited region. We propose to apply the same methods
to the entire public GALEX database, in order to eliminate remaining
discontinuities in the current photometry and step-like background
artifacts in sky maps. This work will have two principal products: (1)
the updated photometric catalog for all GALEX sources, and (2) a Legacy
all-sky coadd for both the FUV and NUV bands. Traditional GALEX pipeline
analysis only stacked exposures that were obtained as part of the same
planned survey tile. However, a substantial degree of overlap between
independent GALEX observations does exist and can used to produce a
deeper coadd over much of the sky. Redundant coverage also allows
artifacts such as internal reflections to be masked when stacking. Our
ADAP effort will ideally complement the all-sky unWISE reprocessing
project in infrared bands. We will publicly release all products as they
are produced. This project will positively impact both extragalactic and
Milky Way related science and is therefore relevant to a wide range of
NASA priorities.

%X Fiber optic networks are no longer just pipelines for transporting data
in the long haul backbone. Exponential growth in traffic in metro-
regional areas has pushed higher capacity fiber toward the edge of the
network, and highly dynamic patterns of heterogeneous traffic have
emerged that are often bursty, severely stressing the historical "fat
and dumb pipe" static optical network, which would need to be massively
over-provisioned to deal with these loads. What is required is a more
intelligent network with a span of control over the optical as well as
electrical transport mechanisms which enables handling of service
requests in a fast and efficient way that guarantees quality of service
(QoS) while optimizing capacity efficiency. An "agile" optical network
is a reconfigurable optical network comprised of high speed intelligent
control system fed by real-time in situ network sensing. It provides
fast response in the control and switching of optical signals in
response to changing traffic demands and network conditions. This agile
control of optical signals is enabled by pushing switching decisions
downward in the network stack to the physical layer. Implementing such
agility is challenging due to the response dynamics and interactions of
signals in the physical layer. Control schemes must deal with issues
such as dynamic power equalization, EDFA transients and cascaded noise
effects, impairments due to self-phase modulation and dispersion, and
channel-to-channel cross talk. If these issues are not properly
predicted and mitigated, attempts at dynamic control can drive the
optical network into an unstable state. In order to enable high speed
actuation of signal modulators and switches, the network controller must
be able to make decisions based on predictive models. In this thesis, we
consider how to take advantage of Software Defined Networking (SDN)
capabilities for network reconfiguration, combined with embedded models
that access updates from deployed network monitoring sensors. In order
to maintain signal quality while optimizing network resources, we find
that it is essential to model and update estimates of the physical link
impairments in real-time. In this thesis, we consider the key elements
required to enable an agile optical network, with contributions as
follows: ∙ Control Framework: extended the SDN concept to include the
optical transport network through extensions to the OpenFlow (OF)
protocol. A unified SDN control plane is built to facilitate control and
management capability across the electrical/packet-switched and optical
/circuit-switched portions of the network seamlessly. The SDN control
plane serves as a platform to abstract the resources of
multilayer/multivendor networks. Through this platform, applications can
dynamically request the network resources to meet their service
requirements. ∙ Use of In-situ Monitors: enabled real-time physical
impairment sensing in the control plane using in-situ Optical
Performance Monitoring (OPM) and bit error rate (BER) analyzers. OPM and
BER values are used as quantitative indicators of the link status and
are fed to the control plane through a high-speed data collection
interface to form a closed-loop feedback system to enable adaptive
resource allocation. ∙ Predictive Network Model: used a network model
embedded in the control layer to study the link status. The estimated
results of network status is fed into the control decisions to
precompute the network resources. The performance of the network model
can be enhanced by the sensing results. ∙ Real-Time Control Algorithms:
investigated various dynamic resource allocation mechanisms supporting
an agile optical network. Intelligent routing and wavelength switching
for recovering from traffic impairments is achieved experimentally in
the agile optical network within one second. A distance-adaptive
spectrum allocation scheme to address transmission impairments caused by
cascaded Wavelength Selective Switches (WSS) is proposed and evaluated
for improving network spectral efficiency.

%X Coronal holes are where the fast solar wind streams out of the Suns
atmosphere, sending charged particles on rapid trajectories out into the
solar system. A new study examines how the distribution of coronal holes
has changed over the last 40 years.Coronal holes form where magnetic
field lines open into space (B) instead of looping back to the solar
surface (A). [Sebman81]Source of the Fast Solar WindAs a part of the
Suns natural activity cycle, extremely low-density regions sometimes
form in the solar corona. These coronal holes manifest themselves as
dark patches in X-ray and extreme ultraviolet imaging, since the corona
is much hotter than the solar surface that peeks through from underneath
it.Coronal holes form when magnetic field lines open into space instead
of looping back to the solar surface. In these regions, the solar
atmosphere escapes via these field lines, rapidly streaming away from
the Suns surface in whats known as the fast solar wind.Coronal Holes
Over Space and TimeAutomated detection of coronal holes from image-based
analysis is notoriously difficult. Recently, a team of scientists led by
Kenichi Fujiki (ISEE, Nagoya University, Japan) has developed an
automated prediction technique for coronal holes that relies instead on
magnetic-field data for the Sun, obtained at the National Solar
Observatorys Kitt Peak between 1975 and 2014. The team used these data
to produce a database of 3335 coronal hole predictions over nearly 40
years.Latitude distribution of 2870 coronal holes (each marked by an x;
color indicates polarity), overlaid on the magnetic butterfly map of the
Sun. The low-latitude coronal holes display a similar butterfly pattern,
in which they move closer to the equator over the course of the solar
cycle. Polar coronal holes are more frequent during solar minima.
[Fujiki et al. 2016]Examining trends in the coronal holes distribution
in latitude and time, Fujiki and collaborators find a strong correlation
between the total area covered by low-latitude coronal holes (holes
closer to the Suns equator) and sunspot activity. In contrast, the total
area of high-latitude coronal holes (those near the Suns poles) peaks
around the minimum in each solar cycle and shrinks around each solar
maximum.Predicting the Impact of the Solar WindWhy do these observations
matter? Coronal holes are the source of the fast solar wind, so if we
can better predict the frequency and locations of coronal holes in the
future, we can make better predictions about how the solar wind might
impact us here on Earth.Periodicity of high-latitude (orange) and low-
latitude (blue) coronal-hole areas, and periodicity of galactic cosmic
rays detected at Earth (black). The cosmic rays track the polar coronal-
hole area behavior with a 1-year time lag. [Fujiki et al. 2016]In one
example of this, Fujiki and collaborators show that theres a distinct
correlation between polar coronal-hole area and observed galactic cosmic
rays. Cosmic rays from within our galaxy have long been known to exhibit
a 22-year periodicity. Fujiki and collaborators show that the
periodicity of the galactic cosmic-ray activity tracks that of the polar
coronal-hole area, with a ~1-year lag time which is equivalent to the
propagation time of the solar wind to the termination shock.Polar
coronal holes are therefore a useful observable indicator of the dipole
component of the solar magnetic field, which modulates the incoming
cosmic rays entering our solar system. This coronal hole database will
be a useful tool for understanding the source of solar wind and the many
ways the wind influences the Earth and our solar system.CitationK.

%X A systematic inspection of the far-infrared (FIR) properties of evolved
stars allows not only to constrain physical models, but also to
understand the chemical evolution that takes place in the end of their
lives. In this work we intend to study the circumstellar envelopes (CSE)
on a sample of stars in the THROES catalogue from AGB/post-AGB stars to
planetary nebulae using photometry and spectroscopy provided by the PACS
instrument on-board Herschel telescope. In the first part we are
interested in obtaining an estimate of the size of FIR emitting region
and to sort our targets in two classes: point-like and extended.
Secondly, we focus on the molecular component of the envelope traced by
carbon monoxide (CO) rotational lines. We conduct a line survey on a
sample of evolved stars by identifying and measuring flux of both 12CO
and 13CO isotopologues in the PACS range, while looking at the overall
properties of the sample. Lastly, we will be interested in obtaining
physical parameters of the CSE, namely gas temperature, mass and mass-
loss rate on a sample of carbon stars. For that, we make use of PACS
large wavelength coverage, which enables the simultaneous study of a
large number of CO transitions, to perform the rotational diagram
analysis. We report the detection of CO emission in a high number of
stars from the catalogue, which were mostly classified as point-like
targets with a few exceptions of planetary nebulae. High J rotational
number transitions were detected in a number of targets, revealing the
presence of a significant amount of hot gas (T ̃ 400-900 K) and high
mass-loss rates. We conclude that Herschel/PACS is in a privileged
position to detect a new population of warmer gas, typically missed in
sub-mm/mm observations.

%X A multiwavelength (radio and optical) observing campaign on SS Cyg is
underway, and AAVSO participation is urgently requested. An AAVSO Alert
Notice will be issued February 5 with full details. The purpose of this
Special Notice is to alert observers right now to the need to monitor SS
Cyg very closely and report your observations to the AAVSO via WebObs at
once. It is likely to go into outburst very soon, and immediate
reporting of outburst behavior is crucial to the success of the
campaign. Previous similar campaigns with Dr. James Miller-Jones and his
colleagues have been very successful. AAVSO observations are used to
trigger multi-site radio observations of SS Cyg in research on radio
emission from this dwarf nova, as well as for correlation with the radio
data during analysis. Visual and CCD/DSLR (particularly V) observations
are requested (no time series unless outburst is underway and radio
observations have been triggered). Its normal minimum magnitude is 11.8
V, but it can fluctuate to around 11.5. If it becomes brighter than 11.5
V, it could well be going into outburst. If it reaches 11.0, it is
almost certainly on its way up. Please report your observations of SS
Cyg to the AAVSO as soon after you make them as possible. If you see it
11.5 or brighter, please report them immediately. Finder charts with
sequence may be created using the AAVSO Variable Star Plotter
(https://www.aavso.org/vsp). Observations should be submitted to the
AAVSO International Database. See full Special Notice for more details.

solid-state physics concerning the extreme conditions found within white
dwarfs and the solid crusts of neutron stars. As much of our knowledge
about these compact objects comes from observation of astrophysical
phenomena, Chapter 1 is devoted to the phenomena, and how they can be
exploited as material property probes. Several of the most interesting
phenomena involve the enormous magnetic fields (B ≥ 1012 gauss) harbored
by many neutron stars, and the interaction between these fields and the
charged particles within the solid crust. Accordingly, Chapter 2 reviews
some theory of strongly-magnetized electrons, which both sets the stage
for Chapter 3, and (hopefully) serves as a useful reference for future
research. Let it now be made clear that this dissertation focuses
exclusively on the "outer crusts," of neutron stars, where no free
neutrons are present (rho < 4x1011 g/cc), and the similarly-composed
interiors of white dwarfs, which have central densities ̃ 107 g/cc. For
the most part we specialize to even lower densities. In Chapter 3,
static and dynamic properties of low density (rho ≥ 106 g/cc) outer
envelopes of neutron stars are calculated within the nonlinear magnetic
Thomas-Fermi model, assuming degenerate electrons. A novel domain
decomposition enables proper description of lattice symmetry and may be
seen as a prototype for the general class of problems involving
nonlinear charge screening of periodic, quasi-low-dimensionality
structures, e.g. liquid crystals. We describe a scalable implementation
of the method using Hypre. Over the density range considered, the
effective shear modulus appears to be a factor of ≈ 20 larger than in
the linearlyscreened Coulomb crystal model, which could have
implications for observables related to astroseismology as well as low
temperature phonon-mediated thermal conductivity. Other findings include
incipient c' < 0 elastic instabilities for both bcc and fcc lattices,
reminiscent of the situation in some light actinides, and suggestive of
a symmetry-lowering transition to a tetragonal or orthorhombic lattice.
Chapter 4 describes a systematic search for multicomponent crystal
structures, carried out for five different ternary systems of nuclei in
a polarizable background of electrons, representative of accreted
neutron star crusts and some white dwarfs. Candidate structures are
"bred" by a genetic algorithm, and optimized at constant pressure under
the assumption of linear response (Thomas-Fermi) charge screening.
Subsequent phase equilibria calculations reveal eight distinct crystal
structures in the T = 0 bulk phase diagrams, five of which are
complicated multinary structures not before predicted in the context of
compact object astrophysics. Frequent instances of geometrically similar
but compositionally distinct phases give insight into structural
preferences of systems with pairwise Yukawa interactions, including and
extending to the regime of low density colloidal suspensions made in a
laboratory. As an application of these main results, we self-
consistently couple the phase stability problem to the equations for a
self-gravitating, hydrostatically stable white dwarf, with fixed overall
composition. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to incorporate
complex multinary phases into the equilibrium phase layering diagram and
mass-radius-composition dependence, both of which are reported for
He-C-O and C-O-Ne white dwarfs. Finite thickness interfacial phases
("interphases") show up at the boundaries between single-component bcc
crystalline regions, some of which have lower lattice symmetry than
cubic. A second application---quasi-static settling of heavy nuclei in
white dwarfs---builds on our equilibrium phase layering method. Tests of
this nonequilibrium method reveal extra phases which play the role of
transient host phases for the settling species.

%X Did you know that the very first exoplanets ever confirmed were found
around a pulsar? The precise timing measurements of pulsar PSR 1257+12
were what made the discovery of its planetary companions possible. Yet
surprisingly, though weve discovered thousands of exoplanets since then,
only one other planet has ever been confirmed around a pulsar. Now, a
team of CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science researchers are trying to
figure out why.Formation ChallengesThe lack of detected pulsar planets
may simply reflect the fact that getting a pulsar-planet system is
challenging! There are three main pathways:The planet formed before the
host star became a pulsar which means it somehow survived its star going
supernova (yikes!).The planet formed elsewhere and was captured by the
pulsar.The planet formed out of the debris of the supernova
explosion.The first two options, if even possible, are likely to be rare
occurrences but the third option shows some promise. In this scenario,
after the supernova explosion, a small fraction of the material falls
back toward the stellar remnant and is recaptured, forming what is known
as a supernova fallback disk. According to this model, planets could
potentially form out of this disk.Disk ImplicationsLed by Matthew Kerr,
the CSIRO astronomers set out to systematically look for these potential
planets that might have formed in situ around pulsars. They searched a
sample of 151 young, energetic pulsars, scouring seven years of pulse
time-of-arrival data for periodic variation that could signal the
presence of planetary companions. Their methods to mitigate pulsar
timing noise and model realistic orbits allowed them to have good
sensitivity to low-mass planets.The results? They found no conclusive
evidence that any of these pulsars have planets.This outcome carries
with it some significant implications. The pulsar sample spans 2 Myr in
age, in which planets should have had enough time to form in debris
disks. The fact that none were detected suggests that long-lived
supernova fallback disks may actually be much rarer than thought, or
they exist only in conditions that arent compatible with planet
formation.So if thats the case, what about the planets found around PSR
1257+12? This pulsar may actually be somewhat unique, in that it was
born with an unusually weak magnetic field. This birth defect might have
allowed it to form a fallback disk and, subsequently, planets where the
sample of energetic pulsars studied here could not.CitationM. Kerr et

%X The ability to detect small and localized movements of geotechnical
facilities is important for performance monitoring and early-warning
hazard detection. Current deformation monitoring technology is limited
in its ability to both scan massive structures and detect small and
localized movements. Ground-based interferometric radar (GBIR) is an
emerging remote sensing technology that has the potential to fill this
gap in surface deformation monitoring technology. Much of the focus of
previous research and application of GBIR has been on monitoring large
spatial scale movements, such as mine walls, dams, and earth slopes
experiencing deformational movements occurring over hundreds or
thousands of square meters. In this study the focus is on evaluating the
capabilities of GBIR for detecting and monitoring small movements (mm-
scale) occurring over very localized regions (a few m2). Specifically,
this study focused on the application of GBIR for detecting and
monitoring movements of individual boulders in a massive landscape. The
potential long-term application is to use GBIR to detect and monitor
precursor movements to rockfall events. Boulders, ranging from 0.5 to 5
meters in approximate facial dimensions, were moved using pry bars and
airbag jacks in increments of a few to several mm. Two identical GBIR
devices positioned at separate locations scanned a region covering
approximately 20,000 m2 after each boulder movement. Ground truth
measurements were also performed after each boulder movement. The
detectability of the boulder movements was assessed by comparing the
distribution of measured phase values from the boulder to (1) phase
values measured on the surrounding non-moving portion of the image and
(2) phase values measured from the same boulder when it was not moving.
The results from the study showed that movements of boulders with
dimensions larger than about 2 m were detectable for range offset
distances from about 75 to 150 m. Movements as small of 1.7 mm were
detected on these larger boulders. Phase values associated with
movements of the smaller boulders, with dimensions less than about 2 m,
were more difficult to differentiate from the non-moving portions of the
image. This study successfully demonstrated the potential of GBIR to
fill existing gaps in current displacement and deformation monitoring
technology for geotechnical applications.

%X Recent works show that the restframe colours of X-ray selected AGN host
galaxies at z~1 are no different from those of inactive galaxies once
stellar mass selection effects are taken into account. However, there is
a clear deficit of AGN among quiescent galaxies, and the average star
formation rates of AGN hosts are comparable or higher than those of
inactive star-forming galaxies. These apparently contradictory findings
could be a consequence of higher extinction in star-forming AGN hosts
compensating for their younger stellar populations in observed colours.
In this talk I will present a new method of extinction correction that
breaks the degeneracy with stellar age and metallicity by comparing the
restframe U-V colour with measurements of the Dn(4000) index on
intermediate band photospectra from SHARDS. I'll show that the
distribution of extinction corrected U-V colours and Dn(4000) for AGN
hosts at z<1 is significantly different from that of comparison samples
of inactive galaxies, with a clear deficit of AGN in intrinsic red
galaxies and a higher prevalence among those with intermediate age
stellar populations.

%X SUPERBOX is a particle-mesh code that uses moving sub-grids to track and
resolve high-density peaks in the particle distribution and a nearest
grid point force-calculation scheme based on the second derivatives of
the potential. The code implements a fast low-storage FFT-algorithm and
allows a highly resolved treatment of interactions in clusters of
galaxies, such as high-velocity encounters between elliptical galaxies
and the tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies, as sub-grids follow the
trajectories of individual galaxies. SUPERBOX is efficient in that the
computational overhead is kept as slim as possible and is also memory
efficient since it uses only one set of grids to treat galaxies in
succession.

%X The Low Frequency All Sky Monitor (LoFASM) is a distributed array of
dipole antennas that are sensitive to radio frequencies from 10 to 88
MHz. The primary science goals of LoFASM are the detection and study of
low-frequency radio transients, a high priority science goal as deemed
by the National Research Council's decadal survey. LoFASM consists of
antennas and front-end electronics that were originally developed for
the Long Wavelength Array (LWA) by the U.S. Naval Research Lab, the
University of New Mexico, Virginia Tech, and the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory. LoFASM, funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, will
initially consist of four stations, each consisting of 12 dual-
polarization dipole antennas. In a single station, RF signals from each
of the individual LoFASM dipoles are combined in phase in order to
synthesize LoFASM's beam. The LoFASM RF signals are phased up so that
the resulting beam is sensitive to radio emission that originates from
the zenith and RF signals approaching from the horizon are attenuated.
Digitally, this is achieved using a full Stokes 100MHz correlating
spectrometer constructed using field programmable gate array (FPGA)
technology. In this thesis I will describe the design and usage of the
LoFASM Correlator.

N2  - Accurate flux calibration for the STIS echelle modes is heavily
dependent on the proper alignment of the blaze function for each
spectral order. However, due to changes in the instrument alignment over
time and between exposures, the blaze function can shift in wavelength.
This may result in flux calibration inconsistencies of up to 10%. We
present the stisblazefix Python module as a tool for STIS users to
correct their echelle spectra. The stisblazefix module assumes that the
error in the blaze alignment is a linear function of spectral order, and
finds the set of shifts that minimizes the flux inconsistencies in the
overlap between spectral orders. We discuss the uses and limitations of
this tool, and show that its use can provide significant improvements to
the default pipeline flux calibration for many observations.

N2  - The fluxes of <SUP>3</SUP>He, <SUP>4</SUP>He, C, O, and Fe ions at low
energies (about 0.04 - 2 MeV/nucleon) are studied during quiet periods
in Solar Cycles (SC) 23 and 24 using data from the ULEIS/ACE instrument.
In selecting quiet periods (the definition is given in Section 2.1),
additional data from EPHIN/SOHO and EPAM/ACE were also used. The
analysis of the ion energy spectra and their relative abundances shows
that their behavior is governed by their first-ionization potential.
Substantial differences in the ion energy spectra in two consecutive
solar cycles are observed during the quiet periods selected. Quiet-time
fluxes are divided into three distinct types according to the {̃} 80 -
320 keV/nucleon Fe/O ratio. Our results confirm the earlier observation
that these types of suprathermal particles have different origins, that
is, they represent different seed populations that are accelerated by
different processes. Except for the solar activity minimum, the Fe/O
ratio during quiet-time periods correspond either to the abundances of
ions in particle fluxes accelerated in impulsive solar flares or to the
mean abundances of elements in the solar corona. At the activity
minimum, this ratio takes on values that are characteristic for the
solar wind. These results indicate that the background fluxes of low-
energy particles in the ascending, maximum, and decay phases of the
solar cycle include significant contributions from both coronal
particles accelerated to suprathermal energies and ions accelerated in
small impulsive solar flares rich in Fe, while the contribution of
remnants from earlier SEP events cannot be excluded. The comparison of
suprathermal ion abundances during the first five years of SC 23 and SC
24 suggests that the quiet-time and non-quiet fluxes of Fe and
<SUP>3</SUP>He were lower in SC 24.

purpose of stellar mass determinations. Many of these systems already
have mass fractions (although generally no spectroscopic orbit - an
astrometric orbit will determine individual masses), metallicity
information, and Hipparcos distances. They will be used to improve our
knowledge of the mass-luminosity relation, particularly for lower-
metallicity stars. Our survey will create the first all-sky, volume-
limited, speckle archive for the two primary samples, complementing a
similar effort that has been recently been completed at the WIYN 3.5-m
telescope in the Northern Hemisphere. This extension to the Southern
Hemisphere will fill out the picture for a wider metallicity range.

N2  - Due to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration and its effect on global
climates, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
proposes a Clean Power Plan (CPP) mandating CO2 reductions which will
likely force the early retirement of inefficient, aging power plants.
Consequentially, removing these plants equates to a shortfall of
approximately 66 GW of electricity. These factors add to the looming
resource problems of choosing whether to build large replacement power
plants or consider alternative energy sources as a means to help close
the gap between electricity supply and demand in a given region. One
energy source, shallow water tidal currents, represents opportunities to
convert kinetic energy to mechanical forms and provide electricity to
homes and businesses. Nearly 2,000 National Oceanic Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) tidal current data points from Maine to Texas are
considered. This paper, based on systems engineering thinking, provides
key attributes (e.g. turbine efficiency, array size, transmission
losses) for consideration as decision makers seek to identify where to
site Marine Hydrokinetic (MHK) systems and the number of homes powered
by the practical harvest of electricity from tidal currents at those
locations with given attributes. A systems engineering process model is
proposed for consideration as is a regression based equation to estimate
MHK machine parameters needed for power a given number of homes.

N2  - The observed evolution of the broad-band spectral energy distribution
(SED) in NS X-ray Nova Aql X-1 during the rise phase of a bright Fast-
Rise-Exponential-Decay-type outburst in 2013 can be understood in the
framework of thermal emission from non-stationary accretion disc with
radial temperature distribution transforming from a single-temperature
blackbody emitting ring into the multicolour irradiated accretion disc.
SED evolution during the hard to soft X-ray state transition looks
unusual, as it cannot be reproduced by the standard disc irradiation
model with a single irradiation parameter for NUV, Optical and NIR
spectral bands. NIR (NUV) band is correlated with soft (hard) X-ray flux
changes during the state transition interval, respectively. In our
interpretation, at the moment of X-ray state transition UV-emitting
parts of the accretion disc are screened from direct X-ray illumination
from the central source and are heated primarily by hard X-rays (E > 10
keV), scattered in the hot corona or wind possibly formed above the
optically thick outer accretion flow; the outer edge of multicolour
disc, which emits in Optical-NIR, can be heated primarily by direct
X-ray illumination. We point out that future simultaneous
multiwavelength observations of X-ray Nova systems during the fast X-ray
state transition interval are of great importance, as it can serve as
'X-ray tomograph' to study physical conditions in outer regions of
accretion flow. This can provide an effective tool to directly test the
energy-dependent X-ray heating efficiency, vertical structure and
accretion flow geometry in transient low-mass X-ray binaries.

N2  - The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover carries a suite of
meteorological detectors that constitute the Rover Environmental
Monitoring Station (REMS) instrument. REMS investigates the
meteorological conditions at Gale crater by obtaining high-frequency
data of pressure, air and ground temperature, relative humidity, UV flux
at the surface and wind intensity and direction with some limitations in
the wind data. We have run a search of atmospheric pressure drops of
short duration (< 25 s) and we present a statistical study of the
frequency of these events in the REMS pressure data during its first
1417 sols (more than two Martian years). The identified daytime pressure
drops could be caused by the close passages of warm vortices and dust
devils. Previous systematic searches of warm vortices from REMS pressure
data (Kahanpää et al., 2016; Steakley and Murphy, 2016) cover about one
Martian year. We show that sudden pressure drops are twice more abundant
in the second Martian year [sols 671-1339] than in the first one
analyzed in previous works. The higher number of detections could be
linked to a combination of different topography, higher altitudes (120 m
above the landing site) and true inter-annual meteorological
variability. We found 1129 events with a pressure drop larger than 0.5
Pa. Of these, 635 occurred during the local daytime (∼56%) and 494 were
nocturnal. The most intense pressure drop (4.2 Pa) occurred at daytime
on sol 1417 (areocentric solar longitude L<SUB>s</SUB> = 195°) and was
accompanied by a simultaneous decrease in the UV signal of 7.1%,
pointing to a true dust devil. We also discuss similar but less intense
simultaneous pressure and UV radiation drops that constitute 0.7% of all
daytime events. Most of the intense daytime pressure drops with
variations larger than 1.0 Pa occur when the difference between air and
ground temperature is larger than 15 K. Statistically, the frequency of
daytime pressure drops peaks close to noon (12:00-13:00 Local True Solar
Time or LTST) with more events in spring and summer (L<SUB>s</SUB> from
180° to 360°). The nocturnal sudden pressure drops concentrate in the
20:00-23:00 LTST time interval and they only occur in spring and summer.
We interpret these nocturnal events as a consequence of local
mechanically forced turbulence. This interpretation is consistent with
published results from simulations with the MRAMS model (Rafkin et al.,
2016) that predict a competition between local orographic circulation
and global Hadley cell circulation at Gale crater at summer night-time
that can enhance forced turbulence at the surface. Bursts of pressure
drops appear on particular sols, especially at night-time. Most of the
vortex bursts occurred when MSL was in the region called Pahrump Hills
characterized by a complex terrain. A comparison of the daytime pressure
drops from REMS data with published results from the Pathfinder and
Phoenix missions shows that the frequency of daytime events at Gale
crater in spring and summer is similar to the one previously found at
other locations. Finally, we present possible correlations between MSL
activity and some daytime pressure drops. If such an instrumental effect
is present in the REMS data its impact in this analysis is small and
would only affect about 7% of our detections.

at any temperature above the critical temperature. An analogous result
holds for Markov random fields satisfying a high-noise assumption and

N2  - This work is the first study on the 3D shape of starbursting extremely
metal-poor galaxies (XMPs; a galaxy is said to be an XMP if its ionized
gas-phase metallicity is less than 1/10 the solar value). A few hundred
XMPs have been identified in the local universe primarily through mining
the spectroscopic catalog of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and
follow-up observations have shown that metallicity drops significantly
at the starburst (compared to the quiescent component of the galaxy). As
the timescale for gas mixing is short, the metal-poor gas triggering the
starburst must have been accreted recently. This is strong observational
evidence for the cold flow accretion predicted by cosmological models of
galaxy formation, and, in this respect, XMPs seem to be the best local
analogs of the very first galaxies.The ellipsoidal shape of a class of
galaxies can be inferred from the observed axial ratio (q) distribution
(q = minor axis/major axis) of a large sample of randomly-oriented
galaxies. Fitting ellipses to 200 XMPs using r-band SDSS images, we
observe that the axial ratio distribution falls off at q < ~0.4 and q >
~0.8, and we determine that these falloffs are not due to biases in the
data. The falloff at low axial ratio indicates that the XMPs are thick
for their size, and the falloff at high axial ratio suggests the vast
majority of XMPs are triaxial. We also observe that smaller XMPs are
thicker in proportion to their size, and it is expected that for
decreasing galaxy size the ratio of random to rotational motions
increases, which correlates with increasing relative thickness. The XMPs
are low-redshift dwarf galaxies dominated by dark matter, and our
results are compatible with simulations that have shown dark matter
halos to be triaxial, with triaxial stellar distributions for low-mass
galaxies and with triaxiality increasing over time. We will offer
precise constraints on the 3D shape of XMPs via Bayesian analysis of our
observed axial ratio distribution.This work has been supported by the La
Caixa Foundation and the Estallidos Spanish Ministry of Science and
Innovation grant.

N2  - Studies in the last 10 years of dust formation in core-collapse
supernovae (CCSNe) have found only small amounts, 0.001 solar masses.
This is far less than the amount needed to account for the large masses
of dust seen in some high redshift galaxies. However, the recent
discovery of 1 solar mass of cold dust in the ejecta of SN 1987A has has
caused a complete re-evaluation of dust formation in CCSNe. It has been
suggested that the CCSNe are continuously forming dust so that by the
time they are about 25 years old they will have dust masses similar to
SN 1987A. However, there is a wide time gap between the CCSNe that have
been studied recently and SN 1987A. We plan to use the sensitivity of
Spitzer to detect dust emission from SN 2017eaw at two epochs less than
a year after explosion. Radiative transfer models will be used to
estimate the dust masses. These observations will provide a necessary
baseline for our proposed JWST DD ERS observations. This is part of a
long term study to look for evidence of continuous dust formation in
CCSNe. These observations will help shed light on the mystery of dust in
the early universe. SSC Note: A 2019 epoch was added by the TAC.

N2  - We investigate the scaling properties of EUV intensity fluctuations seen
in low-latitude coronal holes (CH) and in regions of Quiet Sun (QS), in
signals obtained with the SDO/AIA instrument in the 193 Å waveband.
Contemporaneous time series in the 171 and 211 Å wavebands are used for
comparison among emissions at different heights in the transition region
and low corona. Potential-field extrapolations of contemporaneous
SDO/HMI line-of-sight magnetic fields provide a context in the physical
environment. Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) shows that the
variance of the fluctuations obeys a power-law as a function of temporal
scales with periods in the range ~15-60 min. This scaling is
characterized by a generalized Hurst exponent α. In QS regions, and in
regions within CHs that include magnetic bipoles, the scaling exponent
lies in the range 1.0 < α < 1.5, and it thus corresponds to anti-
correlated, turbulent-like, dynamical processes. Regions inside the
coronal holes primarily associated with magnetic field of a dominant
single polarity, have a generalized exponent (0.5 < α < 1) corresponding
to positively correlated (“persistent”) processes. The results indicate
the influence of the magnetic fields on the dynamics of the emission.

N2  - Flares are thought to be sudden releases of magnetic energy stored
around starspots. Recent space high-precision photometry shows
“superflares”, 10-10<SUP>4</SUP> times more energetic than the largest
solar flares, occur on many G, K, M-type stars (e.g., Maehara+2012
Nature). Harmful UV/X-ray radiation and high-energy particles such as
protons are caused by such superflares. This may suggest that exoplanet
host stars have severe effects on the physical and chemical evolution of
exoplanetary atmospheres (cf. Segura+2010 Astrobiology, Takahashi+2016
ApJL).We here present statistical properties of superflares on G, K,
M-type stars on the basis of our analyses of Kepler photometric data
(Maehara+2012 Nature, Shibayama+2013 ApJS, Notsu+2013 ApJ,
Canderaresi+2014 ApJ, Maehara+2015 EPS, Maehara+2017 PASJ). We found
more than 5000 superflares on 800 G, K, M-type main-sequence stars, and
the occurrence frequency (dN/dE) of superflares as a function of flare
energy (E) shows the power-law distribution with the index of -1.8 -1.9.
This power-law distribution is consistent with that of solar
flares.Flare frequency increases as stellar temperature decreases. As
for M-type stars, energy of the largest flares is smaller compared with
G,K-type stars, but more frequent “hazardous” flares for the habitable
planets since the habitable zone around M-type stars is much smaller
compared with G, K-type stars.Rotation period and starspot coverage can
be estimated from the quasi-periodic brightness variation of the
superflare stars. The intensity of Ca II 8542 line of superflare stars,
which is measured from spectroscopic observations with Subaru Telescope,
has a well correlation with the brightness variation amplitude
(Notsu+2015a&b PASJ).Flare frequency has a correlation with rotation
period, and this suggests young rapidly-rotating stars (like “young
Sun”) have more severe impacts of flares on the planetary atmosphere
(cf. Airapetian+2016 ApJL). Flare energy and frequency also depends on
starspot coverage, and this suggests existence of large starspots is
important factor of superflares.These statistical properties of
superflares discussed here can be one of the basic information for
considering the impacts of flares on planet-host stars.

N2  - Different groups of meteorites have distinctive isotopic compositions.
In a 2011 paper, Paul Warren (University of California, Los Angeles)
showed that there is a clear dichotomy in chromium and titanium isotopic
compositions between carbonaceous chondrites and all the other types of
stony meteorites, plus Earth, Moon, and Mars. Thomas Kruijer (Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, California and University of Münster,
Germany) and colleagues at the University of Münster now show that the
dichotomy involves iron meteorites as well as rocky ones. The two
distinct groups were nicknamed the CC (those with isotopes like
carbonaceous chondrites) and NC (those with isotopes like non-
carbonaceous meteorites). Kruijer and colleagues were able to determine
the time of core formation in the planetesimals in which iron meteorites
formed and report that CC iron meteorites formed 2.2 to 2.8 million
years after CAI formation, whereas the NC iron meteorites formed
earlier, before 1.8 million years after CAIs. (CAIs, calcium-aluminum-
rich inclusions, are the first solids to form in the Solar System and
give us a time-zero reference marker.) The accretion of the
planetesimals preceded core formation. Thermal calculations done by
Kruijer and colleagues indicate that NC objects accreted at 0.4 million
years after CAIs. In contrast, the CC objects accreted at 0.9 million
years after CAIs. Kruijer and colleagues suggest on the basis of their
results and published models for the formation of Jupiter that the
dichotomy resulted from Jupiter's formation. The NC materials accreted
when there was a continuous gas disk characterized by solids flowing
inwards towards the Sun. However, less than a million years later,
something interrupted this continuous flow, leading to formation of the
isotopic dichotomy. Kruijer and coworkers suggest that rapid accretion
of Jupiter's solid, mostly rocky core was the event that disrupted the
continuous inwards flow. Models suggest that Jupiter would have grown to
about 20 Earth masses, after which it grew by accreting gases to it. The
ages of the NC and CC iron meteorite groups indicate that Jupiter's
rocky core formed about 1 million years after CAIs. Sophisticated models
for planetary accretion predict early formation of the rocky core of
Jupiter, but suggest this process took between 1 and 10 million years
(after CAIs). Quantitative meteorite data show that the time was around
a million years, providing useful input for improving the models and
showing the value of combining theory with data on ancient samples.

N2  - Fluctuations are one of the main probes of the physics of the new state
of hot and dense nuclear matter called the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP)
which is created in the ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. In this
dissertation we extend and improve upon the existing descriptions of
heavy ion collisions in three different directions: we study the new
signatures of initial state fluctuations, the propagation of
perturbations in the early stages of the collision, and the effect of
thermal fluctuations on the hydrodynamic expansion of the QGP. First, in
Chapter 3 we study initial state fluctuations by examining the complete
statistical information contained in the two-particle correlation
measurements in hydrodynamic simulations of Pb+Pb collisions at the CERN
Large Hadron Collider (√sNN = 2.76 TeV). We use Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) to decompose the spectrum of harmonic flow, v_n(p_T) for
n = 0-5, into dominant components. The leading component is identified
with the standard event plane vn(pT), while the subleading component
describes additional fluctuations in the two-particle correlation
function. We find good geometric predictors for the orientation and the
magnitude of the leading and the subleading flows. The subleading v 0,
v1, and v3 flow harmonics are shown to be a response to the radial
excitation of the corresponding eccentricity epsilonn. In contrast, for
v2 the subleading flow in peripheral collisions is dominated by the
nonlinear mixing between the leading elliptic flow and radial flow
fluctuations. Nonlinear mixing also plays a significant role in
generating subleading v4 and v 5 harmonics. The PCA gives a systematic
way of studying the full information of the two-particle correlation
matrix and identifying the subleading flows, which we show are
responsible for factorization breaking in hydrodynamics. Second, in
Chapter 4 we study the thermalization and hydrodynamization of
fluctuations at the early stages of heavy ion collisions. We use leading
order effective kinetic theory, accurate at weak coupling, to simulate
the pre-equilibrium evolution of transverse energy and flow
perturbations. For the short evolution we can use a linear response
theory to construct the pre-equilibrium Green functions. Then the
energy-momentum tensor at a time when hydrodynamics becomes applicable
can be expressed as a linear convolution of response functions with the
initial perturbations. We propose combining effective kinetic theory
with weak coupling initial state models, such as IP-Glasma, to model the
complete pre-thermal evolution from saturated nuclei to hydrodynamics in
a weak coupling framework. Last, in Chapter 5 we consider out-of-
equilibrium hydrodynamic fluctuations in the expanding QGP. We develop a
set of kinetic equations for a correlator of thermal fluctuations which
are equivalent to nonlinear hydrodynamics with noise. We first show that
the kinetic response precisely reproduces the one-loop renormalization
of the shear viscosity for a static fluid. We then use the hydro-kinetic
equations to analyze thermal fluctuations for a Bjorken expansion. The
steady state solution to the kinetic equations determine the coefficient
of the first fractional power of the gradient expansion (infinity 1/(tau
T)3/2), which was computed here for the first time. The formalism of
hydro-kinetic equations can be applied to more general background flows
and coupled to existing viscous hydrodynamic codes to incorporate the
physics of hydrodynamic fluctuations.

N2  - How do magnetic fields form and evolve in early galaxies? A new study
has provided some clever observations to help us answer this
question.The Puzzle of Growing FieldsDynamo theory is the primary model
describing how magnetic fields develop in galaxies. In this picture,
magnetic fields start out as weak seed fields that are small and
unordered. These fields then become ordered and amplified by large-scale
rotation and turbulence in galaxy disks and halos, eventually leading to
the magnetic fields we observe in galaxies today.Schematic showinghow to
indirectly measure protogalactic magnetic fields. The measured
polarization of a background quasar is altered by the fields in a
foreground protogalaxy. Click for a closer look! [Farnes et al.
2017/Adolf Schaller/STSCI/NRAO/AUI/NSF]To test this model, we need
observations of the magnetic fields in young protogalaxies.
Unfortunately, we dont have the sensitivity to be able to measure these
fields directly but a team of scientists led by Jamie Farnes (Radboud
University in the Netherlands) have come up with a creative
alternative.The key is to find early protogalaxies that absorb the light
of more distant background objects. If a protogalaxy lies between us and
a distant quasar, then magnetic fields of the protogalaxy if present
will affect the polarization measurements of the background
quasar.Observing Galactic Building BlocksTop: Redshift distribution for
the background quasars in the authors sample. Bottom: Redshift
distribution for the foreground protogalaxies the authors are exploring.
[Farnes et al. 2017]Farnes and collaborators examined two types of
foreground protogalaxies: Damped Lyman-Alpha Absorbers (DLAs) and Lyman
Limit Systems (LLSs). They obtained polarimetric data for a sample of
114 distant quasars with nothing in the foreground (the control sample),
19 quasars with DLAs in the foreground, and 27 quasars with LLSs in the
foreground. They then used statistical analysis techniques to draw
conclusions about the magnetic fields in the foreground
protogalaxies.Farnes and collaborators were unable to detect either
coherent or random magnetic fields in DLAs. LLSs, however, showed some
evidence of coherent magnetic fields and significant evidence of
incoherent magnetic fields. The observations show that the magnetized
gas in LLSs must be highly turbulent on a scale of 520 parsecs similar
to turbulence scales in the Milky Way.Support for DynamosWhat do these
observations imply? Both support the dynamo theory of magnetic field
growth in galaxies!Polarization fraction distributions (top) and their
logarithms (bottom) for sources with and without protogalaxies in the
foreground (pink for DLAs, blue for LLSs, and grey for no intervenor).
Statistical analysis reveals that the distribution for LLSs differs from
the control sample, indicating the presence of magnetized gas. [Adapted
from Farnes et al. 2017]The DLAs appear to consist of mostly non-
turbulent quiescent gas; no dynamo action is currently occurring in
these protogalaxies. The LLSs, on the other hand, appear to be growing
their random magnetic fields via a turbulent dynamo. Thefields have not
yet had enough time to become ordered like the fields of more evolved
galaxies, however.Farnes and collaborators data indicate that magnetic
fields are indeed being gradually built up in early galaxies by dynamos.
They also suggest that DLAs may represent an earlier galactic
evolutionary stage than LLSs, as DLAs havent yet had the time to develop
their magnetic fields to a detectable level.A future increase in sample
size will certainly help improve our understanding of the field
formation process. In the meantime, the data in this study provide the
first observational picture of magnetic field evolution in galaxies,
lending excellent support to theoretical models.CitationJ. S. Farnes et

N2  - Hurricane Bonnie (1998) was an unusually resilient hurricane that
maintained intensity in 12-16 ms-1 vertical wind shear and during an
eyewall replacement cycle from 23-25 August. This remarkable behavior
was examined using observations from flight-level data, microwave
imagery, radar, and dropsondes over the two-day period. The symmetric
and asymmetric aspects of Bonnie's eyewall replacement cycle were
documented and compared to eyewall replacement cycles in other
hurricanes. Similar to other observed eyewall replacement cycles, Bonnie
exhibited the development, strengthening, and dominance of a secondary
eyewall while a primary eyewall decayed. However, Bonnie's structure was
highly asymmetric due to strong 12-16 ms-1 vertical wind shear, in
contrast to the more symmetric structures observed in other hurricanes
undergoing eyewall replacement cycles. It is hypothesized that strong
shear preferentially forced convection downshear, which was able to
extend upshear and form a secondary eyewall through enhanced surface
fluxes upshear. The larger radius of maximum winds after the eyewall
replacement cycle completed might have aided Bonnie's resiliency in
shear by increasing the likelihood that diabatic heating would fall
inside the radius of maximum winds. These observations of Hurricane
Bonnie's ability to maintain intensity in spite of high shear and an
eyewall replacement cycle, both of which usually result in weakening,
provide a new direction from which to view the intensity change issue in
hurricanes.

N2  - Icy grain mantles are the main reservoir for volatile elements in star-
forming regions across the Universe, as well as the formation site of
pre-biotic complex organic molecules (COMs) seen in our Solar System. We
propose to trace the evolution of pristine and complex ice chemistry in
a representative low-mass star-forming region through observations of a:
pre-stellar core, Class 0 protostar, Class I protostar, and
protoplanetary disk. Comparing high spectral resolution (R 1500-3000)
and sensitivity (S/N 100-300) observations from 3 to 15 um to template
spectra, we will map the spatial distribution of ices down to 20-50 AU
in these targets to identify when, and at what visual extinction, the
formation of each ice species begins. Such high-resolution spectra will
allow us to search for new COMs, as well as distinguish between
different ice morphologies,thermal histories, and mixing environments.
The analysis of these data will result in science products beneficial to
Cycle 2 proposers. A newly updated public laboratory ice database will
provide feature identifications for all of the expected ices, while a
chemical model fit to the observed ice abundances will be released
publically as a grid, with varied metallicity and UV fields to simulate
other environments. We will create improved algorithms to extract NIRCAM
WFSS spectra in crowded fields with extended sources as well as optimize
the defringing of MIRI LRS spectra in order to recover broad spectral
features. We anticipate that these resources will be particularly useful
for astrochemistry and spectroscopy of fainter, extended targets like
star forming regions of the SMC/LMC or more distant galaxies.

T1  - Post Common Envelope Binaries as probes of M dwarf stellar wind and habitable zone radiation environments

N2  - M dwarf stars are promising targets in the search for extrasolar
habitable planets, as their small size and close-in habitable zones make
the detection of Earth-analog planets easier than at Solar-type stars.
However, the effects of the high stellar activity of M dwarf hosts has
uncertain effects on such planets, and may render them uninhabitable.
Studying stellar activity at M dwarfs is hindered by a lack of
measurements of high-energy radiation, flare activity and, in
particular, stellar wind rates. We propose to rectify this by observing
a sample of Post Common Envelope Binaries (PCEBs) with HST and XMM-
Newton. PCEBs consist of an M dwarf with a white dwarf companion, which
experiences the same stellar wind and radiation environment as a close-
in planet. The stellar wind of the M dwarf accretes onto the otherwise
pure hydrogen atmosphere white dwarf, producing metal lines detectable
with ultraviolet spectroscopy. The metal lines can be used to measure
accretion rates onto the white dwarf, from with we can accurately infer
the stellar wind mass loss rate of the M dwarf, along with abundances of
key elements. Simultaneous observations with XMM-Newton will probe X-ray
flare occurrence rate and strength, in addition to coronal temperatures.
Performing these measurements over twelve PCEBs will provide a sample of
M dwarf stellar wind strengths, flare occurrence and X-ray/UV activity
that will finally shed light on the true habitability of planets around
small stars.

N2  - In 2016 we saw the first direct detections of gravitational waves by
Advanced LIGO and the positive results from LISA Pathfinder. In this
context, NASA has decided to partner with the ESA on their L3
gravitational wave observatory, whose science goals are outlined in the
white paper, The Gravitational Universe. The current launch date for L3
is 2034, but with the success of Pathfinder and the increased scientific
interest in gravitational waves caused by LIGO, ESA and its member
states are exploring ways to move up the launch date. In the U.S., the
National Academy's Astronomy Midterm Assessment has recommended that
NASA restore support for a gravitational wave mission in this decade
with the goal of realizing the full scientific capability of the mission
envisioned in the 2020 decadal. NASA has appointed the L3 Study Team,
charged with providing analysis of potential U.S. contributions to the
European-led L3 mission and preparing for the next decadal survey. The
LISA mission concept, proposed for L3, will improve our understanding of
the formation and growth of massive black holes, create a census of
compact binary systems in the Milky Way, test general relativity in
extreme conditions, provide predictions of black hole binary mergers in
the LIGO frequency band, and enable searches for new physics.

T1  - Ubercalibration of GALEX photometry and production of an optimal, all-sky FUV, NUV coadd image

N2  - Modern data analysis methods such as photometric ubercalibration and
optimized mosaicing with background matching have enhanced the public
products of many large astronomical surveys, but unfortunately not yet
for the GALEX mission. This is significant because GALEX provided our
only view of the entire ultraviolet (UV) sky - a circumstance unlikely
to change for many years. We have recently achieved both these
calibration goals for a subset of the GALEX observations toward the
Magellanic Clouds, substantially increasing the quality and internal
consistency of the source catalogs and fidelity of the diffuse emission
morphology in this limited region. We propose to apply the same methods
to the entire public GALEX database, in order to eliminate remaining
discontinuities in the current photometry and step-like background
artifacts in sky maps. This work will have two principal products: (1)
the updated photometric catalog for all GALEX sources, and (2) a Legacy
all-sky coadd for both the FUV and NUV bands. Traditional GALEX pipeline
analysis only stacked exposures that were obtained as part of the same
planned survey tile. However, a substantial degree of overlap between
independent GALEX observations does exist and can used to produce a
deeper coadd over much of the sky. Redundant coverage also allows
artifacts such as internal reflections to be masked when stacking. Our
ADAP effort will ideally complement the all-sky unWISE reprocessing
project in infrared bands. We will publicly release all products as they
are produced. This project will positively impact both extragalactic and
Milky Way related science and is therefore relevant to a wide range of
NASA priorities.

UR  - https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2016PhDT........58L
N2  - Fiber optic networks are no longer just pipelines for transporting data
in the long haul backbone. Exponential growth in traffic in metro-
regional areas has pushed higher capacity fiber toward the edge of the
network, and highly dynamic patterns of heterogeneous traffic have
emerged that are often bursty, severely stressing the historical "fat
and dumb pipe" static optical network, which would need to be massively
over-provisioned to deal with these loads. What is required is a more
intelligent network with a span of control over the optical as well as
electrical transport mechanisms which enables handling of service
requests in a fast and efficient way that guarantees quality of service
(QoS) while optimizing capacity efficiency. An "agile" optical network
is a reconfigurable optical network comprised of high speed intelligent
control system fed by real-time in situ network sensing. It provides
fast response in the control and switching of optical signals in
response to changing traffic demands and network conditions. This agile
control of optical signals is enabled by pushing switching decisions
downward in the network stack to the physical layer. Implementing such
agility is challenging due to the response dynamics and interactions of
signals in the physical layer. Control schemes must deal with issues
such as dynamic power equalization, EDFA transients and cascaded noise
effects, impairments due to self-phase modulation and dispersion, and
channel-to-channel cross talk. If these issues are not properly
predicted and mitigated, attempts at dynamic control can drive the
optical network into an unstable state. In order to enable high speed
actuation of signal modulators and switches, the network controller must
be able to make decisions based on predictive models. In this thesis, we
consider how to take advantage of Software Defined Networking (SDN)
capabilities for network reconfiguration, combined with embedded models
that access updates from deployed network monitoring sensors. In order
to maintain signal quality while optimizing network resources, we find
that it is essential to model and update estimates of the physical link
impairments in real-time. In this thesis, we consider the key elements
required to enable an agile optical network, with contributions as
follows: ∙ Control Framework: extended the SDN concept to include the
optical transport network through extensions to the OpenFlow (OF)
protocol. A unified SDN control plane is built to facilitate control and
management capability across the electrical/packet-switched and optical
/circuit-switched portions of the network seamlessly. The SDN control
plane serves as a platform to abstract the resources of
multilayer/multivendor networks. Through this platform, applications can
dynamically request the network resources to meet their service
requirements. ∙ Use of In-situ Monitors: enabled real-time physical
impairment sensing in the control plane using in-situ Optical
Performance Monitoring (OPM) and bit error rate (BER) analyzers. OPM and
BER values are used as quantitative indicators of the link status and
are fed to the control plane through a high-speed data collection
interface to form a closed-loop feedback system to enable adaptive
resource allocation. ∙ Predictive Network Model: used a network model
embedded in the control layer to study the link status. The estimated
results of network status is fed into the control decisions to
precompute the network resources. The performance of the network model
can be enhanced by the sensing results. ∙ Real-Time Control Algorithms:
investigated various dynamic resource allocation mechanisms supporting
an agile optical network. Intelligent routing and wavelength switching
for recovering from traffic impairments is achieved experimentally in
the agile optical network within one second. A distance-adaptive
spectrum allocation scheme to address transmission impairments caused by
cascaded Wavelength Selective Switches (WSS) is proposed and evaluated
for improving network spectral efficiency.

N2  - Coronal holes are where the fast solar wind streams out of the Suns
atmosphere, sending charged particles on rapid trajectories out into the
solar system. A new study examines how the distribution of coronal holes
has changed over the last 40 years.Coronal holes form where magnetic
field lines open into space (B) instead of looping back to the solar
surface (A). [Sebman81]Source of the Fast Solar WindAs a part of the
Suns natural activity cycle, extremely low-density regions sometimes
form in the solar corona. These coronal holes manifest themselves as
dark patches in X-ray and extreme ultraviolet imaging, since the corona
is much hotter than the solar surface that peeks through from underneath
it.Coronal holes form when magnetic field lines open into space instead
of looping back to the solar surface. In these regions, the solar
atmosphere escapes via these field lines, rapidly streaming away from
the Suns surface in whats known as the fast solar wind.Coronal Holes
Over Space and TimeAutomated detection of coronal holes from image-based
analysis is notoriously difficult. Recently, a team of scientists led by
Kenichi Fujiki (ISEE, Nagoya University, Japan) has developed an
automated prediction technique for coronal holes that relies instead on
magnetic-field data for the Sun, obtained at the National Solar
Observatorys Kitt Peak between 1975 and 2014. The team used these data
to produce a database of 3335 coronal hole predictions over nearly 40
years.Latitude distribution of 2870 coronal holes (each marked by an x;
color indicates polarity), overlaid on the magnetic butterfly map of the
Sun. The low-latitude coronal holes display a similar butterfly pattern,
in which they move closer to the equator over the course of the solar
cycle. Polar coronal holes are more frequent during solar minima.
[Fujiki et al. 2016]Examining trends in the coronal holes distribution
in latitude and time, Fujiki and collaborators find a strong correlation
between the total area covered by low-latitude coronal holes (holes
closer to the Suns equator) and sunspot activity. In contrast, the total
area of high-latitude coronal holes (those near the Suns poles) peaks
around the minimum in each solar cycle and shrinks around each solar
maximum.Predicting the Impact of the Solar WindWhy do these observations
matter? Coronal holes are the source of the fast solar wind, so if we
can better predict the frequency and locations of coronal holes in the
future, we can make better predictions about how the solar wind might
impact us here on Earth.Periodicity of high-latitude (orange) and low-
latitude (blue) coronal-hole areas, and periodicity of galactic cosmic
rays detected at Earth (black). The cosmic rays track the polar coronal-
hole area behavior with a 1-year time lag. [Fujiki et al. 2016]In one
example of this, Fujiki and collaborators show that theres a distinct
correlation between polar coronal-hole area and observed galactic cosmic
rays. Cosmic rays from within our galaxy have long been known to exhibit
a 22-year periodicity. Fujiki and collaborators show that the
periodicity of the galactic cosmic-ray activity tracks that of the polar
coronal-hole area, with a ~1-year lag time which is equivalent to the
propagation time of the solar wind to the termination shock.Polar
coronal holes are therefore a useful observable indicator of the dipole
component of the solar magnetic field, which modulates the incoming
cosmic rays entering our solar system. This coronal hole database will
be a useful tool for understanding the source of solar wind and the many
ways the wind influences the Earth and our solar system.CitationK.

N2  - A systematic inspection of the far-infrared (FIR) properties of evolved
stars allows not only to constrain physical models, but also to
understand the chemical evolution that takes place in the end of their
lives. In this work we intend to study the circumstellar envelopes (CSE)
on a sample of stars in the THROES catalogue from AGB/post-AGB stars to
planetary nebulae using photometry and spectroscopy provided by the PACS
instrument on-board Herschel telescope. In the first part we are
interested in obtaining an estimate of the size of FIR emitting region
and to sort our targets in two classes: point-like and extended.
Secondly, we focus on the molecular component of the envelope traced by
carbon monoxide (CO) rotational lines. We conduct a line survey on a
sample of evolved stars by identifying and measuring flux of both 12CO
and 13CO isotopologues in the PACS range, while looking at the overall
properties of the sample. Lastly, we will be interested in obtaining
physical parameters of the CSE, namely gas temperature, mass and mass-
loss rate on a sample of carbon stars. For that, we make use of PACS
large wavelength coverage, which enables the simultaneous study of a
large number of CO transitions, to perform the rotational diagram
analysis. We report the detection of CO emission in a high number of
stars from the catalogue, which were mostly classified as point-like
targets with a few exceptions of planetary nebulae. High J rotational
number transitions were detected in a number of targets, revealing the
presence of a significant amount of hot gas (T ̃ 400-900 K) and high
mass-loss rates. We conclude that Herschel/PACS is in a privileged
position to detect a new population of warmer gas, typically missed in
sub-mm/mm observations.

Notice will be issued February 5 with full details. The purpose of this
Special Notice is to alert observers right now to the need to monitor SS
Cyg very closely and report your observations to the AAVSO via WebObs at
once. It is likely to go into outburst very soon, and immediate
reporting of outburst behavior is crucial to the success of the
campaign. Previous similar campaigns with Dr. James Miller-Jones and his
colleagues have been very successful. AAVSO observations are used to
trigger multi-site radio observations of SS Cyg in research on radio
emission from this dwarf nova, as well as for correlation with the radio
data during analysis. Visual and CCD/DSLR (particularly V) observations
are requested (no time series unless outburst is underway and radio
observations have been triggered). Its normal minimum magnitude is 11.8
V, but it can fluctuate to around 11.5. If it becomes brighter than 11.5
V, it could well be going into outburst. If it reaches 11.0, it is
almost certainly on its way up. Please report your observations of SS
Cyg to the AAVSO as soon after you make them as possible. If you see it
11.5 or brighter, please report them immediately. Finder charts with
sequence may be created using the AAVSO Variable Star Plotter
(https://www.aavso.org/vsp). Observations should be submitted to the
AAVSO International Database. See full Special Notice for more details.

N2  - Two research endeavors are described in this dissertation; both
undertake problems in solid-state astrophysics, which is a branch of
solid-state physics concerning the extreme conditions found within white
dwarfs and the solid crusts of neutron stars. As much of our knowledge
about these compact objects comes from observation of astrophysical
phenomena, Chapter 1 is devoted to the phenomena, and how they can be
exploited as material property probes. Several of the most interesting
phenomena involve the enormous magnetic fields (B ≥ 1012 gauss) harbored
by many neutron stars, and the interaction between these fields and the
charged particles within the solid crust. Accordingly, Chapter 2 reviews
some theory of strongly-magnetized electrons, which both sets the stage
for Chapter 3, and (hopefully) serves as a useful reference for future
research. Let it now be made clear that this dissertation focuses
exclusively on the "outer crusts," of neutron stars, where no free
neutrons are present (rho < 4x1011 g/cc), and the similarly-composed
interiors of white dwarfs, which have central densities ̃ 107 g/cc. For
the most part we specialize to even lower densities. In Chapter 3,
static and dynamic properties of low density (rho ≥ 106 g/cc) outer
envelopes of neutron stars are calculated within the nonlinear magnetic
Thomas-Fermi model, assuming degenerate electrons. A novel domain
decomposition enables proper description of lattice symmetry and may be
seen as a prototype for the general class of problems involving
nonlinear charge screening of periodic, quasi-low-dimensionality
structures, e.g. liquid crystals. We describe a scalable implementation
of the method using Hypre. Over the density range considered, the
effective shear modulus appears to be a factor of ≈ 20 larger than in
the linearlyscreened Coulomb crystal model, which could have
implications for observables related to astroseismology as well as low
temperature phonon-mediated thermal conductivity. Other findings include
incipient c' < 0 elastic instabilities for both bcc and fcc lattices,
reminiscent of the situation in some light actinides, and suggestive of
a symmetry-lowering transition to a tetragonal or orthorhombic lattice.
Chapter 4 describes a systematic search for multicomponent crystal
structures, carried out for five different ternary systems of nuclei in
a polarizable background of electrons, representative of accreted
neutron star crusts and some white dwarfs. Candidate structures are
"bred" by a genetic algorithm, and optimized at constant pressure under
the assumption of linear response (Thomas-Fermi) charge screening.
Subsequent phase equilibria calculations reveal eight distinct crystal
structures in the T = 0 bulk phase diagrams, five of which are
complicated multinary structures not before predicted in the context of
compact object astrophysics. Frequent instances of geometrically similar
but compositionally distinct phases give insight into structural
preferences of systems with pairwise Yukawa interactions, including and
extending to the regime of low density colloidal suspensions made in a
laboratory. As an application of these main results, we self-
consistently couple the phase stability problem to the equations for a
self-gravitating, hydrostatically stable white dwarf, with fixed overall
composition. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to incorporate
complex multinary phases into the equilibrium phase layering diagram and
mass-radius-composition dependence, both of which are reported for
He-C-O and C-O-Ne white dwarfs. Finite thickness interfacial phases
("interphases") show up at the boundaries between single-component bcc
crystalline regions, some of which have lower lattice symmetry than
cubic. A second application---quasi-static settling of heavy nuclei in
white dwarfs---builds on our equilibrium phase layering method. Tests of
this nonequilibrium method reveal extra phases which play the role of
transient host phases for the settling species.

N2  - Did you know that the very first exoplanets ever confirmed were found
around a pulsar? The precise timing measurements of pulsar PSR 1257+12
were what made the discovery of its planetary companions possible. Yet
surprisingly, though weve discovered thousands of exoplanets since then,
only one other planet has ever been confirmed around a pulsar. Now, a
team of CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science researchers are trying to
figure out why.Formation ChallengesThe lack of detected pulsar planets
may simply reflect the fact that getting a pulsar-planet system is
challenging! There are three main pathways:The planet formed before the
host star became a pulsar which means it somehow survived its star going
supernova (yikes!).The planet formed elsewhere and was captured by the
pulsar.The planet formed out of the debris of the supernova
explosion.The first two options, if even possible, are likely to be rare
occurrences but the third option shows some promise. In this scenario,
after the supernova explosion, a small fraction of the material falls
back toward the stellar remnant and is recaptured, forming what is known
as a supernova fallback disk. According to this model, planets could
potentially form out of this disk.Disk ImplicationsLed by Matthew Kerr,
the CSIRO astronomers set out to systematically look for these potential
planets that might have formed in situ around pulsars. They searched a
sample of 151 young, energetic pulsars, scouring seven years of pulse
time-of-arrival data for periodic variation that could signal the
presence of planetary companions. Their methods to mitigate pulsar
timing noise and model realistic orbits allowed them to have good
sensitivity to low-mass planets.The results? They found no conclusive
evidence that any of these pulsars have planets.This outcome carries
with it some significant implications. The pulsar sample spans 2 Myr in
age, in which planets should have had enough time to form in debris
disks. The fact that none were detected suggests that long-lived
supernova fallback disks may actually be much rarer than thought, or
they exist only in conditions that arent compatible with planet
formation.So if thats the case, what about the planets found around PSR
1257+12? This pulsar may actually be somewhat unique, in that it was
born with an unusually weak magnetic field. This birth defect might have
allowed it to form a fallback disk and, subsequently, planets where the
sample of energetic pulsars studied here could not.CitationM. Kerr et

N2  - The ability to detect small and localized movements of geotechnical
facilities is important for performance monitoring and early-warning
hazard detection. Current deformation monitoring technology is limited
in its ability to both scan massive structures and detect small and
localized movements. Ground-based interferometric radar (GBIR) is an
emerging remote sensing technology that has the potential to fill this
gap in surface deformation monitoring technology. Much of the focus of
previous research and application of GBIR has been on monitoring large
spatial scale movements, such as mine walls, dams, and earth slopes
experiencing deformational movements occurring over hundreds or
thousands of square meters. In this study the focus is on evaluating the
capabilities of GBIR for detecting and monitoring small movements (mm-
scale) occurring over very localized regions (a few m2). Specifically,
this study focused on the application of GBIR for detecting and
monitoring movements of individual boulders in a massive landscape. The
potential long-term application is to use GBIR to detect and monitor
precursor movements to rockfall events. Boulders, ranging from 0.5 to 5
meters in approximate facial dimensions, were moved using pry bars and
airbag jacks in increments of a few to several mm. Two identical GBIR
devices positioned at separate locations scanned a region covering
approximately 20,000 m2 after each boulder movement. Ground truth
measurements were also performed after each boulder movement. The
detectability of the boulder movements was assessed by comparing the
distribution of measured phase values from the boulder to (1) phase
values measured on the surrounding non-moving portion of the image and
(2) phase values measured from the same boulder when it was not moving.
The results from the study showed that movements of boulders with
dimensions larger than about 2 m were detectable for range offset
distances from about 75 to 150 m. Movements as small of 1.7 mm were
detected on these larger boulders. Phase values associated with
movements of the smaller boulders, with dimensions less than about 2 m,
were more difficult to differentiate from the non-moving portions of the
image. This study successfully demonstrated the potential of GBIR to
fill existing gaps in current displacement and deformation monitoring
technology for geotechnical applications.

N2  - Recent works show that the restframe colours of X-ray selected AGN host
galaxies at z~1 are no different from those of inactive galaxies once
stellar mass selection effects are taken into account. However, there is
a clear deficit of AGN among quiescent galaxies, and the average star
formation rates of AGN hosts are comparable or higher than those of
inactive star-forming galaxies. These apparently contradictory findings
could be a consequence of higher extinction in star-forming AGN hosts
compensating for their younger stellar populations in observed colours.
In this talk I will present a new method of extinction correction that
breaks the degeneracy with stellar age and metallicity by comparing the
restframe U-V colour with measurements of the Dn(4000) index on
intermediate band photospectra from SHARDS. I'll show that the
distribution of extinction corrected U-V colours and Dn(4000) for AGN
hosts at z<1 is significantly different from that of comparison samples
of inactive galaxies, with a clear deficit of AGN in intrinsic red
galaxies and a higher prevalence among those with intermediate age
stellar populations.

N2  - SUPERBOX is a particle-mesh code that uses moving sub-grids to track and
resolve high-density peaks in the particle distribution and a nearest
grid point force-calculation scheme based on the second derivatives of
the potential. The code implements a fast low-storage FFT-algorithm and
allows a highly resolved treatment of interactions in clusters of
galaxies, such as high-velocity encounters between elliptical galaxies
and the tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies, as sub-grids follow the
trajectories of individual galaxies. SUPERBOX is efficient in that the
computational overhead is kept as slim as possible and is also memory
efficient since it uses only one set of grids to treat galaxies in
succession.

N2  - The Low Frequency All Sky Monitor (LoFASM) is a distributed array of
dipole antennas that are sensitive to radio frequencies from 10 to 88
MHz. The primary science goals of LoFASM are the detection and study of
low-frequency radio transients, a high priority science goal as deemed
by the National Research Council's decadal survey. LoFASM consists of
antennas and front-end electronics that were originally developed for
the Long Wavelength Array (LWA) by the U.S. Naval Research Lab, the
University of New Mexico, Virginia Tech, and the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory. LoFASM, funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, will
initially consist of four stations, each consisting of 12 dual-
polarization dipole antennas. In a single station, RF signals from each
of the individual LoFASM dipoles are combined in phase in order to
synthesize LoFASM's beam. The LoFASM RF signals are phased up so that
the resulting beam is sensitive to radio emission that originates from
the zenith and RF signals approaching from the horizon are attenuated.
Digitally, this is achieved using a full Stokes 100MHz correlating
spectrometer constructed using field programmable gate array (FPGA)
technology. In this thesis I will describe the design and usage of the
LoFASM Correlator.

N2  - Accurate flux calibration for the STIS echelle modes is heavily
dependent on the proper alignment of the blaze function for each
spectral order. However, due to changes in the instrument alignment over
time and between exposures, the blaze function can shift in wavelength.
This may result in flux calibration inconsistencies of up to 10%. We
present the stisblazefix Python module as a tool for STIS users to
correct their echelle spectra. The stisblazefix module assumes that the
error in the blaze alignment is a linear function of spectral order, and
finds the set of shifts that minimizes the flux inconsistencies in the
overlap between spectral orders. We discuss the uses and limitations of
this tool, and show that its use can provide significant improvements to
the default pipeline flux calibration for many observations.

N2  - The fluxes of <SUP>3</SUP>He, <SUP>4</SUP>He, C, O, and Fe ions at low
energies (about 0.04 - 2 MeV/nucleon) are studied during quiet periods
in Solar Cycles (SC) 23 and 24 using data from the ULEIS/ACE instrument.
In selecting quiet periods (the definition is given in Section 2.1),
additional data from EPHIN/SOHO and EPAM/ACE were also used. The
analysis of the ion energy spectra and their relative abundances shows
that their behavior is governed by their first-ionization potential.
Substantial differences in the ion energy spectra in two consecutive
solar cycles are observed during the quiet periods selected. Quiet-time
fluxes are divided into three distinct types according to the {̃} 80 -
320 keV/nucleon Fe/O ratio. Our results confirm the earlier observation
that these types of suprathermal particles have different origins, that
is, they represent different seed populations that are accelerated by
different processes. Except for the solar activity minimum, the Fe/O
ratio during quiet-time periods correspond either to the abundances of
ions in particle fluxes accelerated in impulsive solar flares or to the
mean abundances of elements in the solar corona. At the activity
minimum, this ratio takes on values that are characteristic for the
solar wind. These results indicate that the background fluxes of low-
energy particles in the ascending, maximum, and decay phases of the
solar cycle include significant contributions from both coronal
particles accelerated to suprathermal energies and ions accelerated in
small impulsive solar flares rich in Fe, while the contribution of
remnants from earlier SEP events cannot be excluded. The comparison of
suprathermal ion abundances during the first five years of SC 23 and SC
24 suggests that the quiet-time and non-quiet fluxes of Fe and
<SUP>3</SUP>He were lower in SC 24.

represent our best chance to take advantage of Gaia parallaxes for the
purpose of stellar mass determinations. Many of these systems already
have mass fractions (although generally no spectroscopic orbit - an
astrometric orbit will determine individual masses), metallicity
information, and Hipparcos distances. They will be used to improve our
knowledge of the mass-luminosity relation, particularly for lower-
metallicity stars. Our survey will create the first all-sky, volume-
limited, speckle archive for the two primary samples, complementing a
similar effort that has been recently been completed at the WIYN 3.5-m

Hemisphere will fill out the picture for a wider metallicity range.

N2  - Due to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration and its effect on global
climates, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
proposes a Clean Power Plan (CPP) mandating CO2 reductions which will
likely force the early retirement of inefficient, aging power plants.
Consequentially, removing these plants equates to a shortfall of
approximately 66 GW of electricity. These factors add to the looming
resource problems of choosing whether to build large replacement power
plants or consider alternative energy sources as a means to help close
the gap between electricity supply and demand in a given region. One
energy source, shallow water tidal currents, represents opportunities to
convert kinetic energy to mechanical forms and provide electricity to
homes and businesses. Nearly 2,000 National Oceanic Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) tidal current data points from Maine to Texas are
considered. This paper, based on systems engineering thinking, provides
key attributes (e.g. turbine efficiency, array size, transmission
losses) for consideration as decision makers seek to identify where to
site Marine Hydrokinetic (MHK) systems and the number of homes powered
by the practical harvest of electricity from tidal currents at those
locations with given attributes. A systems engineering process model is
proposed for consideration as is a regression based equation to estimate
MHK machine parameters needed for power a given number of homes.

N2  - The observed evolution of the broad-band spectral energy distribution
(SED) in NS X-ray Nova Aql X-1 during the rise phase of a bright Fast-
Rise-Exponential-Decay-type outburst in 2013 can be understood in the
framework of thermal emission from non-stationary accretion disc with
radial temperature distribution transforming from a single-temperature
blackbody emitting ring into the multicolour irradiated accretion disc.
SED evolution during the hard to soft X-ray state transition looks
unusual, as it cannot be reproduced by the standard disc irradiation
model with a single irradiation parameter for NUV, Optical and NIR
spectral bands. NIR (NUV) band is correlated with soft (hard) X-ray flux
changes during the state transition interval, respectively. In our
interpretation, at the moment of X-ray state transition UV-emitting
parts of the accretion disc are screened from direct X-ray illumination
from the central source and are heated primarily by hard X-rays (E > 10
keV), scattered in the hot corona or wind possibly formed above the
optically thick outer accretion flow; the outer edge of multicolour
disc, which emits in Optical-NIR, can be heated primarily by direct
X-ray illumination. We point out that future simultaneous
multiwavelength observations of X-ray Nova systems during the fast X-ray
state transition interval are of great importance, as it can serve as
'X-ray tomograph' to study physical conditions in outer regions of
accretion flow. This can provide an effective tool to directly test the
energy-dependent X-ray heating efficiency, vertical structure and
accretion flow geometry in transient low-mass X-ray binaries.

N2  - The Karl Schwarzschild Meeting 2017 (KSM2017) has been the third
instalment of the conference dedicated to the great Frankfurter
scientist, who derived the first black hole solution of Einstein's
equations about 100 years ago. The event has been a 5 day meeting in the
field of black holes, AdS/CFT correspondence and gravitational physics.
Like the two previous instalments, the conference continued to attract a
stellar ensemble of participants from the world's most renowned
institutions. The core of the meeting has been a series of invited talks
from eminent experts (keynote speakers) as well as the presence of
plenary research talks by students and junior speakers.

N2  - The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover carries a suite of
meteorological detectors that constitute the Rover Environmental
Monitoring Station (REMS) instrument. REMS investigates the
meteorological conditions at Gale crater by obtaining high-frequency
data of pressure, air and ground temperature, relative humidity, UV flux
at the surface and wind intensity and direction with some limitations in
the wind data. We have run a search of atmospheric pressure drops of
short duration (< 25 s) and we present a statistical study of the
frequency of these events in the REMS pressure data during its first
1417 sols (more than two Martian years). The identified daytime pressure
drops could be caused by the close passages of warm vortices and dust
devils. Previous systematic searches of warm vortices from REMS pressure
data (Kahanpää et al., 2016; Steakley and Murphy, 2016) cover about one
Martian year. We show that sudden pressure drops are twice more abundant
in the second Martian year [sols 671-1339] than in the first one
analyzed in previous works. The higher number of detections could be
linked to a combination of different topography, higher altitudes (120 m
above the landing site) and true inter-annual meteorological
variability. We found 1129 events with a pressure drop larger than 0.5
Pa. Of these, 635 occurred during the local daytime (∼56%) and 494 were
nocturnal. The most intense pressure drop (4.2 Pa) occurred at daytime
on sol 1417 (areocentric solar longitude L<SUB>s</SUB> = 195°) and was
accompanied by a simultaneous decrease in the UV signal of 7.1%,
pointing to a true dust devil. We also discuss similar but less intense
simultaneous pressure and UV radiation drops that constitute 0.7% of all
daytime events. Most of the intense daytime pressure drops with
variations larger than 1.0 Pa occur when the difference between air and
ground temperature is larger than 15 K. Statistically, the frequency of
daytime pressure drops peaks close to noon (12:00-13:00 Local True Solar
Time or LTST) with more events in spring and summer (L<SUB>s</SUB> from
180° to 360°). The nocturnal sudden pressure drops concentrate in the
20:00-23:00 LTST time interval and they only occur in spring and summer.
We interpret these nocturnal events as a consequence of local
mechanically forced turbulence. This interpretation is consistent with
published results from simulations with the MRAMS model (Rafkin et al.,
2016) that predict a competition between local orographic circulation
and global Hadley cell circulation at Gale crater at summer night-time
that can enhance forced turbulence at the surface. Bursts of pressure
drops appear on particular sols, especially at night-time. Most of the
vortex bursts occurred when MSL was in the region called Pahrump Hills
characterized by a complex terrain. A comparison of the daytime pressure
drops from REMS data with published results from the Pathfinder and
Phoenix missions shows that the frequency of daytime events at Gale
crater in spring and summer is similar to the one previously found at
other locations. Finally, we present possible correlations between MSL
activity and some daytime pressure drops. If such an instrumental effect
is present in the REMS data its impact in this analysis is small and
would only affect about 7% of our detections.

at any temperature above the critical temperature. An analogous result
holds for Markov random fields satisfying a high-noise assumption and

N2  - This work is the first study on the 3D shape of starbursting extremely
metal-poor galaxies (XMPs; a galaxy is said to be an XMP if its ionized
gas-phase metallicity is less than 1/10 the solar value). A few hundred
XMPs have been identified in the local universe primarily through mining
the spectroscopic catalog of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and
follow-up observations have shown that metallicity drops significantly
at the starburst (compared to the quiescent component of the galaxy). As
the timescale for gas mixing is short, the metal-poor gas triggering the
starburst must have been accreted recently. This is strong observational
evidence for the cold flow accretion predicted by cosmological models of
galaxy formation, and, in this respect, XMPs seem to be the best local
analogs of the very first galaxies.The ellipsoidal shape of a class of
galaxies can be inferred from the observed axial ratio (q) distribution
(q = minor axis/major axis) of a large sample of randomly-oriented
galaxies. Fitting ellipses to 200 XMPs using r-band SDSS images, we
observe that the axial ratio distribution falls off at q < ~0.4 and q >
~0.8, and we determine that these falloffs are not due to biases in the
data. The falloff at low axial ratio indicates that the XMPs are thick
for their size, and the falloff at high axial ratio suggests the vast
majority of XMPs are triaxial. We also observe that smaller XMPs are
thicker in proportion to their size, and it is expected that for
decreasing galaxy size the ratio of random to rotational motions
increases, which correlates with increasing relative thickness. The XMPs
are low-redshift dwarf galaxies dominated by dark matter, and our
results are compatible with simulations that have shown dark matter
halos to be triaxial, with triaxial stellar distributions for low-mass
galaxies and with triaxiality increasing over time. We will offer
precise constraints on the 3D shape of XMPs via Bayesian analysis of our
observed axial ratio distribution.This work has been supported by the La
Caixa Foundation and the Estallidos Spanish Ministry of Science and
Innovation grant.

N2  - Studies in the last 10 years of dust formation in core-collapse
supernovae (CCSNe) have found only small amounts, 0.001 solar masses.
This is far less than the amount needed to account for the large masses
of dust seen in some high redshift galaxies. However, the recent
discovery of 1 solar mass of cold dust in the ejecta of SN 1987A has has
caused a complete re-evaluation of dust formation in CCSNe. It has been
suggested that the CCSNe are continuously forming dust so that by the
time they are about 25 years old they will have dust masses similar to
SN 1987A. However, there is a wide time gap between the CCSNe that have
been studied recently and SN 1987A. We plan to use the sensitivity of
Spitzer to detect dust emission from SN 2017eaw at two epochs less than
a year after explosion. Radiative transfer models will be used to
estimate the dust masses. These observations will provide a necessary
baseline for our proposed JWST DD ERS observations. This is part of a
long term study to look for evidence of continuous dust formation in
CCSNe. These observations will help shed light on the mystery of dust in
the early universe. SSC Note: A 2019 epoch was added by the TAC.

N2  - We investigate the scaling properties of EUV intensity fluctuations seen
in low-latitude coronal holes (CH) and in regions of Quiet Sun (QS), in
signals obtained with the SDO/AIA instrument in the 193 Å waveband.
Contemporaneous time series in the 171 and 211 Å wavebands are used for
comparison among emissions at different heights in the transition region
and low corona. Potential-field extrapolations of contemporaneous
SDO/HMI line-of-sight magnetic fields provide a context in the physical
environment. Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) shows that the
variance of the fluctuations obeys a power-law as a function of temporal
scales with periods in the range ~15-60 min. This scaling is
characterized by a generalized Hurst exponent α. In QS regions, and in
regions within CHs that include magnetic bipoles, the scaling exponent
lies in the range 1.0 < α < 1.5, and it thus corresponds to anti-
correlated, turbulent-like, dynamical processes. Regions inside the
coronal holes primarily associated with magnetic field of a dominant
single polarity, have a generalized exponent (0.5 < α < 1) corresponding
to positively correlated (“persistent”) processes. The results indicate
the influence of the magnetic fields on the dynamics of the emission.

N2  - Flares are thought to be sudden releases of magnetic energy stored
around starspots. Recent space high-precision photometry shows
“superflares”, 10-10<SUP>4</SUP> times more energetic than the largest
solar flares, occur on many G, K, M-type stars (e.g., Maehara+2012
Nature). Harmful UV/X-ray radiation and high-energy particles such as
protons are caused by such superflares. This may suggest that exoplanet
host stars have severe effects on the physical and chemical evolution of
exoplanetary atmospheres (cf. Segura+2010 Astrobiology, Takahashi+2016
ApJL).We here present statistical properties of superflares on G, K,
M-type stars on the basis of our analyses of Kepler photometric data
(Maehara+2012 Nature, Shibayama+2013 ApJS, Notsu+2013 ApJ,
Canderaresi+2014 ApJ, Maehara+2015 EPS, Maehara+2017 PASJ). We found
more than 5000 superflares on 800 G, K, M-type main-sequence stars, and
the occurrence frequency (dN/dE) of superflares as a function of flare
energy (E) shows the power-law distribution with the index of -1.8 -1.9.
This power-law distribution is consistent with that of solar
flares.Flare frequency increases as stellar temperature decreases. As
for M-type stars, energy of the largest flares is smaller compared with
G,K-type stars, but more frequent “hazardous” flares for the habitable
planets since the habitable zone around M-type stars is much smaller
compared with G, K-type stars.Rotation period and starspot coverage can
be estimated from the quasi-periodic brightness variation of the
superflare stars. The intensity of Ca II 8542 line of superflare stars,
which is measured from spectroscopic observations with Subaru Telescope,
has a well correlation with the brightness variation amplitude
(Notsu+2015a&b PASJ).Flare frequency has a correlation with rotation
period, and this suggests young rapidly-rotating stars (like “young
Sun”) have more severe impacts of flares on the planetary atmosphere
(cf. Airapetian+2016 ApJL). Flare energy and frequency also depends on
starspot coverage, and this suggests existence of large starspots is
important factor of superflares.These statistical properties of
superflares discussed here can be one of the basic information for
considering the impacts of flares on planet-host stars.

N2  - Different groups of meteorites have distinctive isotopic compositions.
In a 2011 paper, Paul Warren (University of California, Los Angeles)
showed that there is a clear dichotomy in chromium and titanium isotopic
compositions between carbonaceous chondrites and all the other types of
stony meteorites, plus Earth, Moon, and Mars. Thomas Kruijer (Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, California and University of Münster,
Germany) and colleagues at the University of Münster now show that the
dichotomy involves iron meteorites as well as rocky ones. The two
distinct groups were nicknamed the CC (those with isotopes like
carbonaceous chondrites) and NC (those with isotopes like non-
carbonaceous meteorites). Kruijer and colleagues were able to determine
the time of core formation in the planetesimals in which iron meteorites
formed and report that CC iron meteorites formed 2.2 to 2.8 million
years after CAI formation, whereas the NC iron meteorites formed
earlier, before 1.8 million years after CAIs. (CAIs, calcium-aluminum-
rich inclusions, are the first solids to form in the Solar System and
give us a time-zero reference marker.) The accretion of the
planetesimals preceded core formation. Thermal calculations done by
Kruijer and colleagues indicate that NC objects accreted at 0.4 million
years after CAIs. In contrast, the CC objects accreted at 0.9 million
years after CAIs. Kruijer and colleagues suggest on the basis of their
results and published models for the formation of Jupiter that the
dichotomy resulted from Jupiter's formation. The NC materials accreted
when there was a continuous gas disk characterized by solids flowing
inwards towards the Sun. However, less than a million years later,
something interrupted this continuous flow, leading to formation of the
isotopic dichotomy. Kruijer and coworkers suggest that rapid accretion
of Jupiter's solid, mostly rocky core was the event that disrupted the
continuous inwards flow. Models suggest that Jupiter would have grown to
about 20 Earth masses, after which it grew by accreting gases to it. The
ages of the NC and CC iron meteorite groups indicate that Jupiter's
rocky core formed about 1 million years after CAIs. Sophisticated models
for planetary accretion predict early formation of the rocky core of
Jupiter, but suggest this process took between 1 and 10 million years
(after CAIs). Quantitative meteorite data show that the time was around
a million years, providing useful input for improving the models and
showing the value of combining theory with data on ancient samples.

N2  - Fluctuations are one of the main probes of the physics of the new state
of hot and dense nuclear matter called the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP)
which is created in the ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. In this
dissertation we extend and improve upon the existing descriptions of
heavy ion collisions in three different directions: we study the new
signatures of initial state fluctuations, the propagation of
perturbations in the early stages of the collision, and the effect of
thermal fluctuations on the hydrodynamic expansion of the QGP. First, in
Chapter 3 we study initial state fluctuations by examining the complete
statistical information contained in the two-particle correlation
measurements in hydrodynamic simulations of Pb+Pb collisions at the CERN
Large Hadron Collider (√sNN = 2.76 TeV). We use Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) to decompose the spectrum of harmonic flow, v_n(p_T) for
n = 0-5, into dominant components. The leading component is identified
with the standard event plane vn(pT), while the subleading component
describes additional fluctuations in the two-particle correlation
function. We find good geometric predictors for the orientation and the
magnitude of the leading and the subleading flows. The subleading v 0,
v1, and v3 flow harmonics are shown to be a response to the radial
excitation of the corresponding eccentricity epsilonn. In contrast, for
v2 the subleading flow in peripheral collisions is dominated by the
nonlinear mixing between the leading elliptic flow and radial flow
fluctuations. Nonlinear mixing also plays a significant role in
generating subleading v4 and v 5 harmonics. The PCA gives a systematic
way of studying the full information of the two-particle correlation
matrix and identifying the subleading flows, which we show are
responsible for factorization breaking in hydrodynamics. Second, in
Chapter 4 we study the thermalization and hydrodynamization of
fluctuations at the early stages of heavy ion collisions. We use leading
order effective kinetic theory, accurate at weak coupling, to simulate
the pre-equilibrium evolution of transverse energy and flow
perturbations. For the short evolution we can use a linear response
theory to construct the pre-equilibrium Green functions. Then the
energy-momentum tensor at a time when hydrodynamics becomes applicable
can be expressed as a linear convolution of response functions with the
initial perturbations. We propose combining effective kinetic theory
with weak coupling initial state models, such as IP-Glasma, to model the
complete pre-thermal evolution from saturated nuclei to hydrodynamics in
a weak coupling framework. Last, in Chapter 5 we consider out-of-
equilibrium hydrodynamic fluctuations in the expanding QGP. We develop a
set of kinetic equations for a correlator of thermal fluctuations which
are equivalent to nonlinear hydrodynamics with noise. We first show that
the kinetic response precisely reproduces the one-loop renormalization
of the shear viscosity for a static fluid. We then use the hydro-kinetic
equations to analyze thermal fluctuations for a Bjorken expansion. The
steady state solution to the kinetic equations determine the coefficient
of the first fractional power of the gradient expansion (infinity 1/(tau
T)3/2), which was computed here for the first time. The formalism of
hydro-kinetic equations can be applied to more general background flows
and coupled to existing viscous hydrodynamic codes to incorporate the
physics of hydrodynamic fluctuations.

N2  - How do magnetic fields form and evolve in early galaxies? A new study
has provided some clever observations to help us answer this
question.The Puzzle of Growing FieldsDynamo theory is the primary model
describing how magnetic fields develop in galaxies. In this picture,
magnetic fields start out as weak seed fields that are small and
unordered. These fields then become ordered and amplified by large-scale
rotation and turbulence in galaxy disks and halos, eventually leading to
the magnetic fields we observe in galaxies today.Schematic showinghow to
indirectly measure protogalactic magnetic fields. The measured
polarization of a background quasar is altered by the fields in a
foreground protogalaxy. Click for a closer look! [Farnes et al.
2017/Adolf Schaller/STSCI/NRAO/AUI/NSF]To test this model, we need
observations of the magnetic fields in young protogalaxies.
Unfortunately, we dont have the sensitivity to be able to measure these
fields directly but a team of scientists led by Jamie Farnes (Radboud
University in the Netherlands) have come up with a creative
alternative.The key is to find early protogalaxies that absorb the light
of more distant background objects. If a protogalaxy lies between us and
a distant quasar, then magnetic fields of the protogalaxy if present
will affect the polarization measurements of the background
quasar.Observing Galactic Building BlocksTop: Redshift distribution for
the background quasars in the authors sample. Bottom: Redshift
distribution for the foreground protogalaxies the authors are exploring.
[Farnes et al. 2017]Farnes and collaborators examined two types of
foreground protogalaxies: Damped Lyman-Alpha Absorbers (DLAs) and Lyman
Limit Systems (LLSs). They obtained polarimetric data for a sample of
114 distant quasars with nothing in the foreground (the control sample),
19 quasars with DLAs in the foreground, and 27 quasars with LLSs in the
foreground. They then used statistical analysis techniques to draw
conclusions about the magnetic fields in the foreground
protogalaxies.Farnes and collaborators were unable to detect either
coherent or random magnetic fields in DLAs. LLSs, however, showed some
evidence of coherent magnetic fields and significant evidence of
incoherent magnetic fields. The observations show that the magnetized
gas in LLSs must be highly turbulent on a scale of 520 parsecs similar
to turbulence scales in the Milky Way.Support for DynamosWhat do these
observations imply? Both support the dynamo theory of magnetic field
growth in galaxies!Polarization fraction distributions (top) and their
logarithms (bottom) for sources with and without protogalaxies in the
foreground (pink for DLAs, blue for LLSs, and grey for no intervenor).
Statistical analysis reveals that the distribution for LLSs differs from
the control sample, indicating the presence of magnetized gas. [Adapted
from Farnes et al. 2017]The DLAs appear to consist of mostly non-
turbulent quiescent gas; no dynamo action is currently occurring in
these protogalaxies. The LLSs, on the other hand, appear to be growing
their random magnetic fields via a turbulent dynamo. Thefields have not
yet had enough time to become ordered like the fields of more evolved
galaxies, however.Farnes and collaborators data indicate that magnetic
fields are indeed being gradually built up in early galaxies by dynamos.
They also suggest that DLAs may represent an earlier galactic
evolutionary stage than LLSs, as DLAs havent yet had the time to develop
their magnetic fields to a detectable level.A future increase in sample
size will certainly help improve our understanding of the field
formation process. In the meantime, the data in this study provide the
first observational picture of magnetic field evolution in galaxies,
lending excellent support to theoretical models.CitationJ. S. Farnes et

N2  - Hurricane Bonnie (1998) was an unusually resilient hurricane that
maintained intensity in 12-16 ms-1 vertical wind shear and during an
eyewall replacement cycle from 23-25 August. This remarkable behavior
was examined using observations from flight-level data, microwave
imagery, radar, and dropsondes over the two-day period. The symmetric
and asymmetric aspects of Bonnie's eyewall replacement cycle were
documented and compared to eyewall replacement cycles in other
hurricanes. Similar to other observed eyewall replacement cycles, Bonnie
exhibited the development, strengthening, and dominance of a secondary
eyewall while a primary eyewall decayed. However, Bonnie's structure was
highly asymmetric due to strong 12-16 ms-1 vertical wind shear, in
contrast to the more symmetric structures observed in other hurricanes
undergoing eyewall replacement cycles. It is hypothesized that strong
shear preferentially forced convection downshear, which was able to
extend upshear and form a secondary eyewall through enhanced surface
fluxes upshear. The larger radius of maximum winds after the eyewall
replacement cycle completed might have aided Bonnie's resiliency in
shear by increasing the likelihood that diabatic heating would fall
inside the radius of maximum winds. These observations of Hurricane
Bonnie's ability to maintain intensity in spite of high shear and an
eyewall replacement cycle, both of which usually result in weakening,
provide a new direction from which to view the intensity change issue in
hurricanes.

N2  - Icy grain mantles are the main reservoir for volatile elements in star-
forming regions across the Universe, as well as the formation site of
pre-biotic complex organic molecules (COMs) seen in our Solar System. We
propose to trace the evolution of pristine and complex ice chemistry in
a representative low-mass star-forming region through observations of a:
pre-stellar core, Class 0 protostar, Class I protostar, and
protoplanetary disk. Comparing high spectral resolution (R 1500-3000)
and sensitivity (S/N 100-300) observations from 3 to 15 um to template
spectra, we will map the spatial distribution of ices down to 20-50 AU
in these targets to identify when, and at what visual extinction, the
formation of each ice species begins. Such high-resolution spectra will
allow us to search for new COMs, as well as distinguish between
different ice morphologies,thermal histories, and mixing environments.
The analysis of these data will result in science products beneficial to
Cycle 2 proposers. A newly updated public laboratory ice database will
provide feature identifications for all of the expected ices, while a
chemical model fit to the observed ice abundances will be released
publically as a grid, with varied metallicity and UV fields to simulate
other environments. We will create improved algorithms to extract NIRCAM
WFSS spectra in crowded fields with extended sources as well as optimize
the defringing of MIRI LRS spectra in order to recover broad spectral
features. We anticipate that these resources will be particularly useful
for astrochemistry and spectroscopy of fainter, extended targets like
star forming regions of the SMC/LMC or more distant galaxies.

T1  - Post Common Envelope Binaries as probes of M dwarf stellar wind and habitable zone radiation environments

N2  - M dwarf stars are promising targets in the search for extrasolar
habitable planets, as their small size and close-in habitable zones make
the detection of Earth-analog planets easier than at Solar-type stars.
However, the effects of the high stellar activity of M dwarf hosts has
uncertain effects on such planets, and may render them uninhabitable.
Studying stellar activity at M dwarfs is hindered by a lack of
measurements of high-energy radiation, flare activity and, in
particular, stellar wind rates. We propose to rectify this by observing
a sample of Post Common Envelope Binaries (PCEBs) with HST and XMM-
Newton. PCEBs consist of an M dwarf with a white dwarf companion, which
experiences the same stellar wind and radiation environment as a close-
in planet. The stellar wind of the M dwarf accretes onto the otherwise
pure hydrogen atmosphere white dwarf, producing metal lines detectable
with ultraviolet spectroscopy. The metal lines can be used to measure
accretion rates onto the white dwarf, from with we can accurately infer
the stellar wind mass loss rate of the M dwarf, along with abundances of
key elements. Simultaneous observations with XMM-Newton will probe X-ray
flare occurrence rate and strength, in addition to coronal temperatures.
Performing these measurements over twelve PCEBs will provide a sample of
M dwarf stellar wind strengths, flare occurrence and X-ray/UV activity
that will finally shed light on the true habitability of planets around
small stars.

N2  - In 2016 we saw the first direct detections of gravitational waves by
Advanced LIGO and the positive results from LISA Pathfinder. In this
context, NASA has decided to partner with the ESA on their L3
gravitational wave observatory, whose science goals are outlined in the
white paper, The Gravitational Universe. The current launch date for L3
is 2034, but with the success of Pathfinder and the increased scientific
interest in gravitational waves caused by LIGO, ESA and its member
states are exploring ways to move up the launch date. In the U.S., the
National Academy's Astronomy Midterm Assessment has recommended that
NASA restore support for a gravitational wave mission in this decade
with the goal of realizing the full scientific capability of the mission
envisioned in the 2020 decadal. NASA has appointed the L3 Study Team,
charged with providing analysis of potential U.S. contributions to the
European-led L3 mission and preparing for the next decadal survey. The
LISA mission concept, proposed for L3, will improve our understanding of
the formation and growth of massive black holes, create a census of
compact binary systems in the Milky Way, test general relativity in
extreme conditions, provide predictions of black hole binary mergers in
the LIGO frequency band, and enable searches for new physics.

T1  - Ubercalibration of GALEX photometry and production of an optimal, all-sky FUV, NUV coadd image

N2  - Modern data analysis methods such as photometric ubercalibration and
optimized mosaicing with background matching have enhanced the public
products of many large astronomical surveys, but unfortunately not yet
for the GALEX mission. This is significant because GALEX provided our
only view of the entire ultraviolet (UV) sky - a circumstance unlikely
to change for many years. We have recently achieved both these
calibration goals for a subset of the GALEX observations toward the
Magellanic Clouds, substantially increasing the quality and internal
consistency of the source catalogs and fidelity of the diffuse emission
morphology in this limited region. We propose to apply the same methods
to the entire public GALEX database, in order to eliminate remaining
discontinuities in the current photometry and step-like background
artifacts in sky maps. This work will have two principal products: (1)
the updated photometric catalog for all GALEX sources, and (2) a Legacy
all-sky coadd for both the FUV and NUV bands. Traditional GALEX pipeline
analysis only stacked exposures that were obtained as part of the same
planned survey tile. However, a substantial degree of overlap between
independent GALEX observations does exist and can used to produce a
deeper coadd over much of the sky. Redundant coverage also allows
artifacts such as internal reflections to be masked when stacking. Our
ADAP effort will ideally complement the all-sky unWISE reprocessing
project in infrared bands. We will publicly release all products as they
are produced. This project will positively impact both extragalactic and
Milky Way related science and is therefore relevant to a wide range of
NASA priorities.

4.5, 5.8, and 8.0um obtained with Spitzer's Infrared Array Camera (IRAC)
and images at 24um obtained with the Multiband Imaging Photometer for
Spitzer (MIPS). The cameras produced images with FWHM=1.6"-1.9" from 3.6
to 8.0um and FWHM=5.9" at 24um. The available data were obtained through
Guaranteed Time Observations for PID = 6, 36, 37 (G. Fazio), 53 (G.
Rieke), 94 (C. Lawrence), 30540 (G. Fazio, J. Houck), and 40302 (J.

N2  - The SkyMapper Early Data Release (EDR) is the initial data release from
the SkyMapper Southern Survey, which aims to create a deep, multi-epoch,
multi-band photometric data set for the entire southern sky. EDR covers
approximately 6700 sq. deg. (one-third) of the southern sky as obtained
by the Short Survey component of the project. All included fields have
at least two visits in good conditions in all six SkyMapper filters
(uvgriz). Object catalogues are complete to magnitude 17-18, depending
on filter. IVOA-complaint table access protocol (TAP), cone search and
simple image access protocol (SIAP) services are available from the
SkyMapper website (http://skymapper.anu.edu.au/), as well as through
tools such as TOPCAT. Data are restricted to Australian astronomers and
their collaborators for twelve months from the release date. Further
details on the reduction of SkyMapper data, along with data quality
improvements, will be released in late 2016 as part of SkyMapper Data
Release 1 (DR1).

N2  - Fiber optic networks are no longer just pipelines for transporting data
in the long haul backbone. Exponential growth in traffic in metro-
regional areas has pushed higher capacity fiber toward the edge of the
network, and highly dynamic patterns of heterogeneous traffic have
emerged that are often bursty, severely stressing the historical "fat
and dumb pipe" static optical network, which would need to be massively
over-provisioned to deal with these loads. What is required is a more
intelligent network with a span of control over the optical as well as
electrical transport mechanisms which enables handling of service
requests in a fast and efficient way that guarantees quality of service
(QoS) while optimizing capacity efficiency. An "agile" optical network
is a reconfigurable optical network comprised of high speed intelligent
control system fed by real-time in situ network sensing. It provides
fast response in the control and switching of optical signals in
response to changing traffic demands and network conditions. This agile
control of optical signals is enabled by pushing switching decisions
downward in the network stack to the physical layer. Implementing such
agility is challenging due to the response dynamics and interactions of
signals in the physical layer. Control schemes must deal with issues
such as dynamic power equalization, EDFA transients and cascaded noise
effects, impairments due to self-phase modulation and dispersion, and
channel-to-channel cross talk. If these issues are not properly
predicted and mitigated, attempts at dynamic control can drive the
optical network into an unstable state. In order to enable high speed
actuation of signal modulators and switches, the network controller must
be able to make decisions based on predictive models. In this thesis, we
consider how to take advantage of Software Defined Networking (SDN)
capabilities for network reconfiguration, combined with embedded models
that access updates from deployed network monitoring sensors. In order
to maintain signal quality while optimizing network resources, we find
that it is essential to model and update estimates of the physical link
impairments in real-time. In this thesis, we consider the key elements
required to enable an agile optical network, with contributions as
follows: ∙ Control Framework: extended the SDN concept to include the
optical transport network through extensions to the OpenFlow (OF)
protocol. A unified SDN control plane is built to facilitate control and
management capability across the electrical/packet-switched and optical
/circuit-switched portions of the network seamlessly. The SDN control
plane serves as a platform to abstract the resources of
multilayer/multivendor networks. Through this platform, applications can
dynamically request the network resources to meet their service
requirements. ∙ Use of In-situ Monitors: enabled real-time physical
impairment sensing in the control plane using in-situ Optical
Performance Monitoring (OPM) and bit error rate (BER) analyzers. OPM and
BER values are used as quantitative indicators of the link status and
are fed to the control plane through a high-speed data collection
interface to form a closed-loop feedback system to enable adaptive
resource allocation. ∙ Predictive Network Model: used a network model
embedded in the control layer to study the link status. The estimated
results of network status is fed into the control decisions to
precompute the network resources. The performance of the network model
can be enhanced by the sensing results. ∙ Real-Time Control Algorithms:
investigated various dynamic resource allocation mechanisms supporting
an agile optical network. Intelligent routing and wavelength switching
for recovering from traffic impairments is achieved experimentally in
the agile optical network within one second. A distance-adaptive
spectrum allocation scheme to address transmission impairments caused by
cascaded Wavelength Selective Switches (WSS) is proposed and evaluated
for improving network spectral efficiency.

N2  - Coronal holes are where the fast solar wind streams out of the Suns
atmosphere, sending charged particles on rapid trajectories out into the
solar system. A new study examines how the distribution of coronal holes
has changed over the last 40 years.Coronal holes form where magnetic
field lines open into space (B) instead of looping back to the solar
surface (A). [Sebman81]Source of the Fast Solar WindAs a part of the
Suns natural activity cycle, extremely low-density regions sometimes
form in the solar corona. These coronal holes manifest themselves as
dark patches in X-ray and extreme ultraviolet imaging, since the corona
is much hotter than the solar surface that peeks through from underneath
it.Coronal holes form when magnetic field lines open into space instead
of looping back to the solar surface. In these regions, the solar
atmosphere escapes via these field lines, rapidly streaming away from
the Suns surface in whats known as the fast solar wind.Coronal Holes
Over Space and TimeAutomated detection of coronal holes from image-based
analysis is notoriously difficult. Recently, a team of scientists led by
Kenichi Fujiki (ISEE, Nagoya University, Japan) has developed an
automated prediction technique for coronal holes that relies instead on
magnetic-field data for the Sun, obtained at the National Solar
Observatorys Kitt Peak between 1975 and 2014. The team used these data
to produce a database of 3335 coronal hole predictions over nearly 40
years.Latitude distribution of 2870 coronal holes (each marked by an x;
color indicates polarity), overlaid on the magnetic butterfly map of the
Sun. The low-latitude coronal holes display a similar butterfly pattern,
in which they move closer to the equator over the course of the solar
cycle. Polar coronal holes are more frequent during solar minima.
[Fujiki et al. 2016]Examining trends in the coronal holes distribution
in latitude and time, Fujiki and collaborators find a strong correlation
between the total area covered by low-latitude coronal holes (holes
closer to the Suns equator) and sunspot activity. In contrast, the total
area of high-latitude coronal holes (those near the Suns poles) peaks
around the minimum in each solar cycle and shrinks around each solar
maximum.Predicting the Impact of the Solar WindWhy do these observations
matter? Coronal holes are the source of the fast solar wind, so if we
can better predict the frequency and locations of coronal holes in the
future, we can make better predictions about how the solar wind might
impact us here on Earth.Periodicity of high-latitude (orange) and low-
latitude (blue) coronal-hole areas, and periodicity of galactic cosmic
rays detected at Earth (black). The cosmic rays track the polar coronal-
hole area behavior with a 1-year time lag. [Fujiki et al. 2016]In one
example of this, Fujiki and collaborators show that theres a distinct
correlation between polar coronal-hole area and observed galactic cosmic
rays. Cosmic rays from within our galaxy have long been known to exhibit
a 22-year periodicity. Fujiki and collaborators show that the
periodicity of the galactic cosmic-ray activity tracks that of the polar
coronal-hole area, with a ~1-year lag time which is equivalent to the
propagation time of the solar wind to the termination shock.Polar
coronal holes are therefore a useful observable indicator of the dipole
component of the solar magnetic field, which modulates the incoming
cosmic rays entering our solar system. This coronal hole database will
be a useful tool for understanding the source of solar wind and the many
ways the wind influences the Earth and our solar system.CitationK.

N2  - A systematic inspection of the far-infrared (FIR) properties of evolved
stars allows not only to constrain physical models, but also to
understand the chemical evolution that takes place in the end of their
lives. In this work we intend to study the circumstellar envelopes (CSE)
on a sample of stars in the THROES catalogue from AGB/post-AGB stars to
planetary nebulae using photometry and spectroscopy provided by the PACS
instrument on-board Herschel telescope. In the first part we are
interested in obtaining an estimate of the size of FIR emitting region
and to sort our targets in two classes: point-like and extended.
Secondly, we focus on the molecular component of the envelope traced by
carbon monoxide (CO) rotational lines. We conduct a line survey on a
sample of evolved stars by identifying and measuring flux of both 12CO
and 13CO isotopologues in the PACS range, while looking at the overall
properties of the sample. Lastly, we will be interested in obtaining
physical parameters of the CSE, namely gas temperature, mass and mass-
loss rate on a sample of carbon stars. For that, we make use of PACS
large wavelength coverage, which enables the simultaneous study of a
large number of CO transitions, to perform the rotational diagram
analysis. We report the detection of CO emission in a high number of
stars from the catalogue, which were mostly classified as point-like
targets with a few exceptions of planetary nebulae. High J rotational
number transitions were detected in a number of targets, revealing the
presence of a significant amount of hot gas (T ̃ 400-900 K) and high
mass-loss rates. We conclude that Herschel/PACS is in a privileged
position to detect a new population of warmer gas, typically missed in
sub-mm/mm observations.

Notice will be issued February 5 with full details. The purpose of this
Special Notice is to alert observers right now to the need to monitor SS
Cyg very closely and report your observations to the AAVSO via WebObs at
once. It is likely to go into outburst very soon, and immediate
reporting of outburst behavior is crucial to the success of the
campaign. Previous similar campaigns with Dr. James Miller-Jones and his
colleagues have been very successful. AAVSO observations are used to
trigger multi-site radio observations of SS Cyg in research on radio
emission from this dwarf nova, as well as for correlation with the radio
data during analysis. Visual and CCD/DSLR (particularly V) observations
are requested (no time series unless outburst is underway and radio
observations have been triggered). Its normal minimum magnitude is 11.8
V, but it can fluctuate to around 11.5. If it becomes brighter than 11.5
V, it could well be going into outburst. If it reaches 11.0, it is
almost certainly on its way up. Please report your observations of SS
Cyg to the AAVSO as soon after you make them as possible. If you see it
11.5 or brighter, please report them immediately. Finder charts with
sequence may be created using the AAVSO Variable Star Plotter
(https://www.aavso.org/vsp). Observations should be submitted to the
AAVSO International Database. See full Special Notice for more details.

N2  - Two research endeavors are described in this dissertation; both
undertake problems in solid-state astrophysics, which is a branch of
solid-state physics concerning the extreme conditions found within white
dwarfs and the solid crusts of neutron stars. As much of our knowledge
about these compact objects comes from observation of astrophysical
phenomena, Chapter 1 is devoted to the phenomena, and how they can be
exploited as material property probes. Several of the most interesting
phenomena involve the enormous magnetic fields (B ≥ 1012 gauss) harbored
by many neutron stars, and the interaction between these fields and the
charged particles within the solid crust. Accordingly, Chapter 2 reviews
some theory of strongly-magnetized electrons, which both sets the stage
for Chapter 3, and (hopefully) serves as a useful reference for future
research. Let it now be made clear that this dissertation focuses
exclusively on the "outer crusts," of neutron stars, where no free
neutrons are present (rho < 4x1011 g/cc), and the similarly-composed
interiors of white dwarfs, which have central densities ̃ 107 g/cc. For
the most part we specialize to even lower densities. In Chapter 3,
static and dynamic properties of low density (rho ≥ 106 g/cc) outer
envelopes of neutron stars are calculated within the nonlinear magnetic
Thomas-Fermi model, assuming degenerate electrons. A novel domain
decomposition enables proper description of lattice symmetry and may be
seen as a prototype for the general class of problems involving
nonlinear charge screening of periodic, quasi-low-dimensionality
structures, e.g. liquid crystals. We describe a scalable implementation
of the method using Hypre. Over the density range considered, the
effective shear modulus appears to be a factor of ≈ 20 larger than in
the linearlyscreened Coulomb crystal model, which could have
implications for observables related to astroseismology as well as low
temperature phonon-mediated thermal conductivity. Other findings include
incipient c' < 0 elastic instabilities for both bcc and fcc lattices,
reminiscent of the situation in some light actinides, and suggestive of
a symmetry-lowering transition to a tetragonal or orthorhombic lattice.
Chapter 4 describes a systematic search for multicomponent crystal
structures, carried out for five different ternary systems of nuclei in
a polarizable background of electrons, representative of accreted
neutron star crusts and some white dwarfs. Candidate structures are
"bred" by a genetic algorithm, and optimized at constant pressure under
the assumption of linear response (Thomas-Fermi) charge screening.
Subsequent phase equilibria calculations reveal eight distinct crystal
structures in the T = 0 bulk phase diagrams, five of which are
complicated multinary structures not before predicted in the context of
compact object astrophysics. Frequent instances of geometrically similar
but compositionally distinct phases give insight into structural
preferences of systems with pairwise Yukawa interactions, including and
extending to the regime of low density colloidal suspensions made in a
laboratory. As an application of these main results, we self-
consistently couple the phase stability problem to the equations for a
self-gravitating, hydrostatically stable white dwarf, with fixed overall
composition. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to incorporate
complex multinary phases into the equilibrium phase layering diagram and
mass-radius-composition dependence, both of which are reported for
He-C-O and C-O-Ne white dwarfs. Finite thickness interfacial phases
("interphases") show up at the boundaries between single-component bcc
crystalline regions, some of which have lower lattice symmetry than
cubic. A second application---quasi-static settling of heavy nuclei in
white dwarfs---builds on our equilibrium phase layering method. Tests of
this nonequilibrium method reveal extra phases which play the role of
transient host phases for the settling species.

N2  - Did you know that the very first exoplanets ever confirmed were found
around a pulsar? The precise timing measurements of pulsar PSR 1257+12
were what made the discovery of its planetary companions possible. Yet
surprisingly, though weve discovered thousands of exoplanets since then,
only one other planet has ever been confirmed around a pulsar. Now, a
team of CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science researchers are trying to
figure out why.Formation ChallengesThe lack of detected pulsar planets
may simply reflect the fact that getting a pulsar-planet system is
challenging! There are three main pathways:The planet formed before the
host star became a pulsar which means it somehow survived its star going
supernova (yikes!).The planet formed elsewhere and was captured by the
pulsar.The planet formed out of the debris of the supernova
explosion.The first two options, if even possible, are likely to be rare
occurrences but the third option shows some promise. In this scenario,
after the supernova explosion, a small fraction of the material falls
back toward the stellar remnant and is recaptured, forming what is known
as a supernova fallback disk. According to this model, planets could
potentially form out of this disk.Disk ImplicationsLed by Matthew Kerr,
the CSIRO astronomers set out to systematically look for these potential
planets that might have formed in situ around pulsars. They searched a
sample of 151 young, energetic pulsars, scouring seven years of pulse
time-of-arrival data for periodic variation that could signal the
presence of planetary companions. Their methods to mitigate pulsar
timing noise and model realistic orbits allowed them to have good
sensitivity to low-mass planets.The results? They found no conclusive
evidence that any of these pulsars have planets.This outcome carries
with it some significant implications. The pulsar sample spans 2 Myr in
age, in which planets should have had enough time to form in debris
disks. The fact that none were detected suggests that long-lived
supernova fallback disks may actually be much rarer than thought, or
they exist only in conditions that arent compatible with planet
formation.So if thats the case, what about the planets found around PSR
1257+12? This pulsar may actually be somewhat unique, in that it was
born with an unusually weak magnetic field. This birth defect might have
allowed it to form a fallback disk and, subsequently, planets where the
sample of energetic pulsars studied here could not.CitationM. Kerr et

N2  - The ability to detect small and localized movements of geotechnical
facilities is important for performance monitoring and early-warning
hazard detection. Current deformation monitoring technology is limited
in its ability to both scan massive structures and detect small and
localized movements. Ground-based interferometric radar (GBIR) is an
emerging remote sensing technology that has the potential to fill this
gap in surface deformation monitoring technology. Much of the focus of
previous research and application of GBIR has been on monitoring large
spatial scale movements, such as mine walls, dams, and earth slopes
experiencing deformational movements occurring over hundreds or
thousands of square meters. In this study the focus is on evaluating the
capabilities of GBIR for detecting and monitoring small movements (mm-
scale) occurring over very localized regions (a few m2). Specifically,
this study focused on the application of GBIR for detecting and
monitoring movements of individual boulders in a massive landscape. The
potential long-term application is to use GBIR to detect and monitor
precursor movements to rockfall events. Boulders, ranging from 0.5 to 5
meters in approximate facial dimensions, were moved using pry bars and
airbag jacks in increments of a few to several mm. Two identical GBIR
devices positioned at separate locations scanned a region covering
approximately 20,000 m2 after each boulder movement. Ground truth
measurements were also performed after each boulder movement. The
detectability of the boulder movements was assessed by comparing the
distribution of measured phase values from the boulder to (1) phase
values measured on the surrounding non-moving portion of the image and
(2) phase values measured from the same boulder when it was not moving.
The results from the study showed that movements of boulders with
dimensions larger than about 2 m were detectable for range offset
distances from about 75 to 150 m. Movements as small of 1.7 mm were
detected on these larger boulders. Phase values associated with
movements of the smaller boulders, with dimensions less than about 2 m,
were more difficult to differentiate from the non-moving portions of the
image. This study successfully demonstrated the potential of GBIR to
fill existing gaps in current displacement and deformation monitoring
technology for geotechnical applications.

formation rates of AGN hosts are comparable or higher than those of
inactive star-forming galaxies. These apparently contradictory findings
could be a consequence of higher extinction in star-forming AGN hosts
compensating for their younger stellar populations in observed colours.
In this talk I will present a new method of extinction correction that
breaks the degeneracy with stellar age and metallicity by comparing the
restframe U-V colour with measurements of the Dn(4000) index on
intermediate band photospectra from SHARDS. I'll show that the
distribution of extinction corrected U-V colours and Dn(4000) for AGN
hosts at z<1 is significantly different from that of comparison samples
of inactive galaxies, with a clear deficit of AGN in intrinsic red
galaxies and a higher prevalence among those with intermediate age
stellar populations.

N2  - SUPERBOX is a particle-mesh code that uses moving sub-grids to track and
resolve high-density peaks in the particle distribution and a nearest
grid point force-calculation scheme based on the second derivatives of
the potential. The code implements a fast low-storage FFT-algorithm and
allows a highly resolved treatment of interactions in clusters of
galaxies, such as high-velocity encounters between elliptical galaxies
and the tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies, as sub-grids follow the
trajectories of individual galaxies. SUPERBOX is efficient in that the
computational overhead is kept as slim as possible and is also memory
efficient since it uses only one set of grids to treat galaxies in
succession.

N2  - The Low Frequency All Sky Monitor (LoFASM) is a distributed array of
dipole antennas that are sensitive to radio frequencies from 10 to 88
MHz. The primary science goals of LoFASM are the detection and study of
low-frequency radio transients, a high priority science goal as deemed
by the National Research Council's decadal survey. LoFASM consists of
antennas and front-end electronics that were originally developed for
the Long Wavelength Array (LWA) by the U.S. Naval Research Lab, the
University of New Mexico, Virginia Tech, and the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory. LoFASM, funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, will
initially consist of four stations, each consisting of 12 dual-
polarization dipole antennas. In a single station, RF signals from each
of the individual LoFASM dipoles are combined in phase in order to
synthesize LoFASM's beam. The LoFASM RF signals are phased up so that
the resulting beam is sensitive to radio emission that originates from
the zenith and RF signals approaching from the horizon are attenuated.
Digitally, this is achieved using a full Stokes 100MHz correlating
spectrometer constructed using field programmable gate array (FPGA)
technology. In this thesis I will describe the design and usage of the
LoFASM Correlator.

AB Accurate flux calibration for the STIS echelle modes is heavily
dependent on the proper alignment of the blaze function for each
spectral order. However, due to changes in the instrument alignment over
time and between exposures, the blaze function can shift in wavelength.
This may result in flux calibration inconsistencies of up to 10%. We
present the stisblazefix Python module as a tool for STIS users to
correct their echelle spectra. The stisblazefix module assumes that the
error in the blaze alignment is a linear function of spectral order, and
finds the set of shifts that minimizes the flux inconsistencies in the
overlap between spectral orders. We discuss the uses and limitations of
this tool, and show that its use can provide significant improvements to
the default pipeline flux calibration for many observations.

AB The fluxes of <SUP>3</SUP>He, <SUP>4</SUP>He, C, O, and Fe ions at low
energies (about 0.04 - 2 MeV/nucleon) are studied during quiet periods
in Solar Cycles (SC) 23 and 24 using data from the ULEIS/ACE instrument.
In selecting quiet periods (the definition is given in Section 2.1),
additional data from EPHIN/SOHO and EPAM/ACE were also used. The
analysis of the ion energy spectra and their relative abundances shows
that their behavior is governed by their first-ionization potential.
Substantial differences in the ion energy spectra in two consecutive
solar cycles are observed during the quiet periods selected. Quiet-time
fluxes are divided into three distinct types according to the {̃} 80 -
320 keV/nucleon Fe/O ratio. Our results confirm the earlier observation
that these types of suprathermal particles have different origins, that
is, they represent different seed populations that are accelerated by
different processes. Except for the solar activity minimum, the Fe/O
ratio during quiet-time periods correspond either to the abundances of
ions in particle fluxes accelerated in impulsive solar flares or to the
mean abundances of elements in the solar corona. At the activity
minimum, this ratio takes on values that are characteristic for the
solar wind. These results indicate that the background fluxes of low-
energy particles in the ascending, maximum, and decay phases of the
solar cycle include significant contributions from both coronal
particles accelerated to suprathermal energies and ions accelerated in
small impulsive solar flares rich in Fe, while the contribution of
remnants from earlier SEP events cannot be excluded. The comparison of
suprathermal ion abundances during the first five years of SC 23 and SC
24 suggests that the quiet-time and non-quiet fluxes of Fe and
<SUP>3</SUP>He were lower in SC 24.

spectroscopic binary stars identified by the Geneva-Copenhagen
spectroscopic survey with the SOAR 4m telescope + HRCam. These systems
represent our best chance to take advantage of Gaia parallaxes for the
purpose of stellar mass determinations. Many of these systems already
have mass fractions (although generally no spectroscopic orbit - an
astrometric orbit will determine individual masses), metallicity
information, and Hipparcos distances. They will be used to improve our
knowledge of the mass-luminosity relation, particularly for lower-
metallicity stars. Our survey will create the first all-sky, volume-
limited, speckle archive for the two primary samples, complementing a
similar effort that has been recently been completed at the WIYN 3.5-m
telescope in the Northern Hemisphere. This extension to the Southern
Hemisphere will fill out the picture for a wider metallicity range.

the event horizon do not exist in static vacuum configurations with
positive cosmological constant. We also show that without a cosmological
constant asymptotically flat solutions cannot possess a degenerate
horizon component. Several independent proofs are presented. One proof
follows easily from differential geometry in the near-horizon limit,
while others use Bakry-Émery-Ricci bounds for static Einstein manifolds.

AB Due to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration and its effect on global
climates, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
proposes a Clean Power Plan (CPP) mandating CO2 reductions which will
likely force the early retirement of inefficient, aging power plants.
Consequentially, removing these plants equates to a shortfall of
approximately 66 GW of electricity. These factors add to the looming
resource problems of choosing whether to build large replacement power
plants or consider alternative energy sources as a means to help close
the gap between electricity supply and demand in a given region. One
energy source, shallow water tidal currents, represents opportunities to
convert kinetic energy to mechanical forms and provide electricity to
homes and businesses. Nearly 2,000 National Oceanic Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) tidal current data points from Maine to Texas are
considered. This paper, based on systems engineering thinking, provides
key attributes (e.g. turbine efficiency, array size, transmission
losses) for consideration as decision makers seek to identify where to
site Marine Hydrokinetic (MHK) systems and the number of homes powered
by the practical harvest of electricity from tidal currents at those
locations with given attributes. A systems engineering process model is
proposed for consideration as is a regression based equation to estimate
MHK machine parameters needed for power a given number of homes.

AB The observed evolution of the broad-band spectral energy distribution
(SED) in NS X-ray Nova Aql X-1 during the rise phase of a bright Fast-
Rise-Exponential-Decay-type outburst in 2013 can be understood in the
framework of thermal emission from non-stationary accretion disc with
radial temperature distribution transforming from a single-temperature
blackbody emitting ring into the multicolour irradiated accretion disc.
SED evolution during the hard to soft X-ray state transition looks
unusual, as it cannot be reproduced by the standard disc irradiation
model with a single irradiation parameter for NUV, Optical and NIR
spectral bands. NIR (NUV) band is correlated with soft (hard) X-ray flux
changes during the state transition interval, respectively. In our
interpretation, at the moment of X-ray state transition UV-emitting
parts of the accretion disc are screened from direct X-ray illumination
from the central source and are heated primarily by hard X-rays (E > 10
keV), scattered in the hot corona or wind possibly formed above the
optically thick outer accretion flow; the outer edge of multicolour
disc, which emits in Optical-NIR, can be heated primarily by direct
X-ray illumination. We point out that future simultaneous
multiwavelength observations of X-ray Nova systems during the fast X-ray
state transition interval are of great importance, as it can serve as
'X-ray tomograph' to study physical conditions in outer regions of
accretion flow. This can provide an effective tool to directly test the
energy-dependent X-ray heating efficiency, vertical structure and
accretion flow geometry in transient low-mass X-ray binaries.

AB The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover carries a suite of
meteorological detectors that constitute the Rover Environmental
Monitoring Station (REMS) instrument. REMS investigates the
meteorological conditions at Gale crater by obtaining high-frequency
data of pressure, air and ground temperature, relative humidity, UV flux
at the surface and wind intensity and direction with some limitations in
the wind data. We have run a search of atmospheric pressure drops of
short duration (< 25 s) and we present a statistical study of the
frequency of these events in the REMS pressure data during its first
1417 sols (more than two Martian years). The identified daytime pressure
drops could be caused by the close passages of warm vortices and dust
devils. Previous systematic searches of warm vortices from REMS pressure
data (Kahanpää et al., 2016; Steakley and Murphy, 2016) cover about one
Martian year. We show that sudden pressure drops are twice more abundant
in the second Martian year [sols 671-1339] than in the first one
analyzed in previous works. The higher number of detections could be
linked to a combination of different topography, higher altitudes (120 m
above the landing site) and true inter-annual meteorological
variability. We found 1129 events with a pressure drop larger than 0.5
Pa. Of these, 635 occurred during the local daytime (∼56%) and 494 were
nocturnal. The most intense pressure drop (4.2 Pa) occurred at daytime
on sol 1417 (areocentric solar longitude L<SUB>s</SUB> = 195°) and was
accompanied by a simultaneous decrease in the UV signal of 7.1%,
pointing to a true dust devil. We also discuss similar but less intense
simultaneous pressure and UV radiation drops that constitute 0.7% of all
daytime events. Most of the intense daytime pressure drops with
variations larger than 1.0 Pa occur when the difference between air and
ground temperature is larger than 15 K. Statistically, the frequency of
daytime pressure drops peaks close to noon (12:00-13:00 Local True Solar
Time or LTST) with more events in spring and summer (L<SUB>s</SUB> from
180° to 360°). The nocturnal sudden pressure drops concentrate in the
20:00-23:00 LTST time interval and they only occur in spring and summer.
We interpret these nocturnal events as a consequence of local
mechanically forced turbulence. This interpretation is consistent with
published results from simulations with the MRAMS model (Rafkin et al.,
2016) that predict a competition between local orographic circulation
and global Hadley cell circulation at Gale crater at summer night-time
that can enhance forced turbulence at the surface. Bursts of pressure
drops appear on particular sols, especially at night-time. Most of the
vortex bursts occurred when MSL was in the region called Pahrump Hills
characterized by a complex terrain. A comparison of the daytime pressure
drops from REMS data with published results from the Pathfinder and
Phoenix missions shows that the frequency of daytime events at Gale
crater in spring and summer is similar to the one previously found at
other locations. Finally, we present possible correlations between MSL
activity and some daytime pressure drops. If such an instrumental effect
is present in the REMS data its impact in this analysis is small and
would only affect about 7% of our detections.

AB This work is the first study on the 3D shape of starbursting extremely
metal-poor galaxies (XMPs; a galaxy is said to be an XMP if its ionized
gas-phase metallicity is less than 1/10 the solar value). A few hundred
XMPs have been identified in the local universe primarily through mining
the spectroscopic catalog of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and
follow-up observations have shown that metallicity drops significantly
at the starburst (compared to the quiescent component of the galaxy). As
the timescale for gas mixing is short, the metal-poor gas triggering the
starburst must have been accreted recently. This is strong observational
evidence for the cold flow accretion predicted by cosmological models of
galaxy formation, and, in this respect, XMPs seem to be the best local
analogs of the very first galaxies.The ellipsoidal shape of a class of
galaxies can be inferred from the observed axial ratio (q) distribution
(q = minor axis/major axis) of a large sample of randomly-oriented
galaxies. Fitting ellipses to 200 XMPs using r-band SDSS images, we
observe that the axial ratio distribution falls off at q < ~0.4 and q >
~0.8, and we determine that these falloffs are not due to biases in the
data. The falloff at low axial ratio indicates that the XMPs are thick
for their size, and the falloff at high axial ratio suggests the vast
majority of XMPs are triaxial. We also observe that smaller XMPs are
thicker in proportion to their size, and it is expected that for
decreasing galaxy size the ratio of random to rotational motions
increases, which correlates with increasing relative thickness. The XMPs
are low-redshift dwarf galaxies dominated by dark matter, and our
results are compatible with simulations that have shown dark matter
halos to be triaxial, with triaxial stellar distributions for low-mass
galaxies and with triaxiality increasing over time. We will offer
precise constraints on the 3D shape of XMPs via Bayesian analysis of our
observed axial ratio distribution.This work has been supported by the La
Caixa Foundation and the Estallidos Spanish Ministry of Science and
Innovation grant.

AB Studies in the last 10 years of dust formation in core-collapse
supernovae (CCSNe) have found only small amounts, 0.001 solar masses.
This is far less than the amount needed to account for the large masses
of dust seen in some high redshift galaxies. However, the recent
discovery of 1 solar mass of cold dust in the ejecta of SN 1987A has has
caused a complete re-evaluation of dust formation in CCSNe. It has been
suggested that the CCSNe are continuously forming dust so that by the
time they are about 25 years old they will have dust masses similar to
SN 1987A. However, there is a wide time gap between the CCSNe that have
been studied recently and SN 1987A. We plan to use the sensitivity of
Spitzer to detect dust emission from SN 2017eaw at two epochs less than
a year after explosion. Radiative transfer models will be used to
estimate the dust masses. These observations will provide a necessary
baseline for our proposed JWST DD ERS observations. This is part of a
long term study to look for evidence of continuous dust formation in
CCSNe. These observations will help shed light on the mystery of dust in
the early universe. SSC Note: A 2019 epoch was added by the TAC.

AB We investigate the scaling properties of EUV intensity fluctuations seen
in low-latitude coronal holes (CH) and in regions of Quiet Sun (QS), in
signals obtained with the SDO/AIA instrument in the 193 Å waveband.
Contemporaneous time series in the 171 and 211 Å wavebands are used for
comparison among emissions at different heights in the transition region
and low corona. Potential-field extrapolations of contemporaneous
SDO/HMI line-of-sight magnetic fields provide a context in the physical
environment. Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) shows that the
variance of the fluctuations obeys a power-law as a function of temporal
scales with periods in the range ~15-60 min. This scaling is
characterized by a generalized Hurst exponent α. In QS regions, and in
regions within CHs that include magnetic bipoles, the scaling exponent
lies in the range 1.0 < α < 1.5, and it thus corresponds to anti-
correlated, turbulent-like, dynamical processes. Regions inside the
coronal holes primarily associated with magnetic field of a dominant
single polarity, have a generalized exponent (0.5 < α < 1) corresponding
to positively correlated (“persistent”) processes. The results indicate
the influence of the magnetic fields on the dynamics of the emission.

AB Flares are thought to be sudden releases of magnetic energy stored
around starspots. Recent space high-precision photometry shows
“superflares”, 10-10<SUP>4</SUP> times more energetic than the largest
solar flares, occur on many G, K, M-type stars (e.g., Maehara+2012
Nature). Harmful UV/X-ray radiation and high-energy particles such as
protons are caused by such superflares. This may suggest that exoplanet
host stars have severe effects on the physical and chemical evolution of
exoplanetary atmospheres (cf. Segura+2010 Astrobiology, Takahashi+2016
ApJL).We here present statistical properties of superflares on G, K,
M-type stars on the basis of our analyses of Kepler photometric data
(Maehara+2012 Nature, Shibayama+2013 ApJS, Notsu+2013 ApJ,
Canderaresi+2014 ApJ, Maehara+2015 EPS, Maehara+2017 PASJ). We found
more than 5000 superflares on 800 G, K, M-type main-sequence stars, and
the occurrence frequency (dN/dE) of superflares as a function of flare
energy (E) shows the power-law distribution with the index of -1.8 -1.9.
This power-law distribution is consistent with that of solar
flares.Flare frequency increases as stellar temperature decreases. As
for M-type stars, energy of the largest flares is smaller compared with
G,K-type stars, but more frequent “hazardous” flares for the habitable
planets since the habitable zone around M-type stars is much smaller
compared with G, K-type stars.Rotation period and starspot coverage can
be estimated from the quasi-periodic brightness variation of the
superflare stars. The intensity of Ca II 8542 line of superflare stars,
which is measured from spectroscopic observations with Subaru Telescope,
has a well correlation with the brightness variation amplitude
(Notsu+2015a&b PASJ).Flare frequency has a correlation with rotation
period, and this suggests young rapidly-rotating stars (like “young
Sun”) have more severe impacts of flares on the planetary atmosphere
(cf. Airapetian+2016 ApJL). Flare energy and frequency also depends on
starspot coverage, and this suggests existence of large starspots is
important factor of superflares.These statistical properties of
superflares discussed here can be one of the basic information for
considering the impacts of flares on planet-host stars.

AB Different groups of meteorites have distinctive isotopic compositions.
In a 2011 paper, Paul Warren (University of California, Los Angeles)
showed that there is a clear dichotomy in chromium and titanium isotopic
compositions between carbonaceous chondrites and all the other types of
stony meteorites, plus Earth, Moon, and Mars. Thomas Kruijer (Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, California and University of Münster,
Germany) and colleagues at the University of Münster now show that the
dichotomy involves iron meteorites as well as rocky ones. The two
distinct groups were nicknamed the CC (those with isotopes like
carbonaceous chondrites) and NC (those with isotopes like non-
carbonaceous meteorites). Kruijer and colleagues were able to determine
the time of core formation in the planetesimals in which iron meteorites
formed and report that CC iron meteorites formed 2.2 to 2.8 million
years after CAI formation, whereas the NC iron meteorites formed
earlier, before 1.8 million years after CAIs. (CAIs, calcium-aluminum-
rich inclusions, are the first solids to form in the Solar System and
give us a time-zero reference marker.) The accretion of the
planetesimals preceded core formation. Thermal calculations done by
Kruijer and colleagues indicate that NC objects accreted at 0.4 million
years after CAIs. In contrast, the CC objects accreted at 0.9 million
years after CAIs. Kruijer and colleagues suggest on the basis of their
results and published models for the formation of Jupiter that the
dichotomy resulted from Jupiter's formation. The NC materials accreted
when there was a continuous gas disk characterized by solids flowing
inwards towards the Sun. However, less than a million years later,
something interrupted this continuous flow, leading to formation of the
isotopic dichotomy. Kruijer and coworkers suggest that rapid accretion
of Jupiter's solid, mostly rocky core was the event that disrupted the
continuous inwards flow. Models suggest that Jupiter would have grown to
about 20 Earth masses, after which it grew by accreting gases to it. The
ages of the NC and CC iron meteorite groups indicate that Jupiter's
rocky core formed about 1 million years after CAIs. Sophisticated models
for planetary accretion predict early formation of the rocky core of
Jupiter, but suggest this process took between 1 and 10 million years
(after CAIs). Quantitative meteorite data show that the time was around
a million years, providing useful input for improving the models and
showing the value of combining theory with data on ancient samples.

AB Fluctuations are one of the main probes of the physics of the new state
of hot and dense nuclear matter called the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP)
which is created in the ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. In this
dissertation we extend and improve upon the existing descriptions of
heavy ion collisions in three different directions: we study the new
signatures of initial state fluctuations, the propagation of
perturbations in the early stages of the collision, and the effect of
thermal fluctuations on the hydrodynamic expansion of the QGP. First, in
Chapter 3 we study initial state fluctuations by examining the complete
statistical information contained in the two-particle correlation
measurements in hydrodynamic simulations of Pb+Pb collisions at the CERN
Large Hadron Collider (√sNN = 2.76 TeV). We use Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) to decompose the spectrum of harmonic flow, v_n(p_T) for
n = 0-5, into dominant components. The leading component is identified
with the standard event plane vn(pT), while the subleading component
describes additional fluctuations in the two-particle correlation
function. We find good geometric predictors for the orientation and the
magnitude of the leading and the subleading flows. The subleading v 0,
v1, and v3 flow harmonics are shown to be a response to the radial
excitation of the corresponding eccentricity epsilonn. In contrast, for
v2 the subleading flow in peripheral collisions is dominated by the
nonlinear mixing between the leading elliptic flow and radial flow
fluctuations. Nonlinear mixing also plays a significant role in
generating subleading v4 and v 5 harmonics. The PCA gives a systematic
way of studying the full information of the two-particle correlation
matrix and identifying the subleading flows, which we show are
responsible for factorization breaking in hydrodynamics. Second, in
Chapter 4 we study the thermalization and hydrodynamization of
fluctuations at the early stages of heavy ion collisions. We use leading
order effective kinetic theory, accurate at weak coupling, to simulate
the pre-equilibrium evolution of transverse energy and flow
perturbations. For the short evolution we can use a linear response
theory to construct the pre-equilibrium Green functions. Then the
energy-momentum tensor at a time when hydrodynamics becomes applicable
can be expressed as a linear convolution of response functions with the
initial perturbations. We propose combining effective kinetic theory
with weak coupling initial state models, such as IP-Glasma, to model the
complete pre-thermal evolution from saturated nuclei to hydrodynamics in
a weak coupling framework. Last, in Chapter 5 we consider out-of-
equilibrium hydrodynamic fluctuations in the expanding QGP. We develop a
set of kinetic equations for a correlator of thermal fluctuations which
are equivalent to nonlinear hydrodynamics with noise. We first show that
the kinetic response precisely reproduces the one-loop renormalization
of the shear viscosity for a static fluid. We then use the hydro-kinetic
equations to analyze thermal fluctuations for a Bjorken expansion. The
steady state solution to the kinetic equations determine the coefficient
of the first fractional power of the gradient expansion (infinity 1/(tau
T)3/2), which was computed here for the first time. The formalism of
hydro-kinetic equations can be applied to more general background flows
and coupled to existing viscous hydrodynamic codes to incorporate the
physics of hydrodynamic fluctuations.

AB How do magnetic fields form and evolve in early galaxies? A new study
has provided some clever observations to help us answer this
question.The Puzzle of Growing FieldsDynamo theory is the primary model
describing how magnetic fields develop in galaxies. In this picture,
magnetic fields start out as weak seed fields that are small and
unordered. These fields then become ordered and amplified by large-scale
rotation and turbulence in galaxy disks and halos, eventually leading to
the magnetic fields we observe in galaxies today.Schematic showinghow to
indirectly measure protogalactic magnetic fields. The measured
polarization of a background quasar is altered by the fields in a
foreground protogalaxy. Click for a closer look! [Farnes et al.
2017/Adolf Schaller/STSCI/NRAO/AUI/NSF]To test this model, we need
observations of the magnetic fields in young protogalaxies.
Unfortunately, we dont have the sensitivity to be able to measure these
fields directly but a team of scientists led by Jamie Farnes (Radboud
University in the Netherlands) have come up with a creative
alternative.The key is to find early protogalaxies that absorb the light
of more distant background objects. If a protogalaxy lies between us and
a distant quasar, then magnetic fields of the protogalaxy if present
will affect the polarization measurements of the background
quasar.Observing Galactic Building BlocksTop: Redshift distribution for
the background quasars in the authors sample. Bottom: Redshift
distribution for the foreground protogalaxies the authors are exploring.
[Farnes et al. 2017]Farnes and collaborators examined two types of
foreground protogalaxies: Damped Lyman-Alpha Absorbers (DLAs) and Lyman
Limit Systems (LLSs). They obtained polarimetric data for a sample of
114 distant quasars with nothing in the foreground (the control sample),
19 quasars with DLAs in the foreground, and 27 quasars with LLSs in the
foreground. They then used statistical analysis techniques to draw
conclusions about the magnetic fields in the foreground
protogalaxies.Farnes and collaborators were unable to detect either
coherent or random magnetic fields in DLAs. LLSs, however, showed some
evidence of coherent magnetic fields and significant evidence of
incoherent magnetic fields. The observations show that the magnetized
gas in LLSs must be highly turbulent on a scale of 520 parsecs similar
to turbulence scales in the Milky Way.Support for DynamosWhat do these
observations imply? Both support the dynamo theory of magnetic field
growth in galaxies!Polarization fraction distributions (top) and their
logarithms (bottom) for sources with and without protogalaxies in the
foreground (pink for DLAs, blue for LLSs, and grey for no intervenor).
Statistical analysis reveals that the distribution for LLSs differs from
the control sample, indicating the presence of magnetized gas. [Adapted
from Farnes et al. 2017]The DLAs appear to consist of mostly non-
turbulent quiescent gas; no dynamo action is currently occurring in
these protogalaxies. The LLSs, on the other hand, appear to be growing
their random magnetic fields via a turbulent dynamo. Thefields have not
yet had enough time to become ordered like the fields of more evolved
galaxies, however.Farnes and collaborators data indicate that magnetic
fields are indeed being gradually built up in early galaxies by dynamos.
They also suggest that DLAs may represent an earlier galactic
evolutionary stage than LLSs, as DLAs havent yet had the time to develop
their magnetic fields to a detectable level.A future increase in sample
size will certainly help improve our understanding of the field
formation process. In the meantime, the data in this study provide the
first observational picture of magnetic field evolution in galaxies,
lending excellent support to theoretical models.CitationJ. S. Farnes et

AB Hurricane Bonnie (1998) was an unusually resilient hurricane that
maintained intensity in 12-16 ms-1 vertical wind shear and during an
eyewall replacement cycle from 23-25 August. This remarkable behavior
was examined using observations from flight-level data, microwave
imagery, radar, and dropsondes over the two-day period. The symmetric
and asymmetric aspects of Bonnie's eyewall replacement cycle were
documented and compared to eyewall replacement cycles in other
hurricanes. Similar to other observed eyewall replacement cycles, Bonnie
exhibited the development, strengthening, and dominance of a secondary
eyewall while a primary eyewall decayed. However, Bonnie's structure was
highly asymmetric due to strong 12-16 ms-1 vertical wind shear, in
contrast to the more symmetric structures observed in other hurricanes
undergoing eyewall replacement cycles. It is hypothesized that strong
shear preferentially forced convection downshear, which was able to
extend upshear and form a secondary eyewall through enhanced surface
fluxes upshear. The larger radius of maximum winds after the eyewall
replacement cycle completed might have aided Bonnie's resiliency in
shear by increasing the likelihood that diabatic heating would fall
inside the radius of maximum winds. These observations of Hurricane
Bonnie's ability to maintain intensity in spite of high shear and an
eyewall replacement cycle, both of which usually result in weakening,
provide a new direction from which to view the intensity change issue in
hurricanes.

AB Icy grain mantles are the main reservoir for volatile elements in star-
forming regions across the Universe, as well as the formation site of
pre-biotic complex organic molecules (COMs) seen in our Solar System. We
propose to trace the evolution of pristine and complex ice chemistry in
a representative low-mass star-forming region through observations of a:
pre-stellar core, Class 0 protostar, Class I protostar, and
protoplanetary disk. Comparing high spectral resolution (R 1500-3000)
and sensitivity (S/N 100-300) observations from 3 to 15 um to template
spectra, we will map the spatial distribution of ices down to 20-50 AU
in these targets to identify when, and at what visual extinction, the
formation of each ice species begins. Such high-resolution spectra will
allow us to search for new COMs, as well as distinguish between
different ice morphologies,thermal histories, and mixing environments.
The analysis of these data will result in science products beneficial to
Cycle 2 proposers. A newly updated public laboratory ice database will
provide feature identifications for all of the expected ices, while a
chemical model fit to the observed ice abundances will be released
publically as a grid, with varied metallicity and UV fields to simulate
other environments. We will create improved algorithms to extract NIRCAM
WFSS spectra in crowded fields with extended sources as well as optimize
the defringing of MIRI LRS spectra in order to recover broad spectral
features. We anticipate that these resources will be particularly useful
for astrochemistry and spectroscopy of fainter, extended targets like
star forming regions of the SMC/LMC or more distant galaxies.

AB M dwarf stars are promising targets in the search for extrasolar
habitable planets, as their small size and close-in habitable zones make
the detection of Earth-analog planets easier than at Solar-type stars.
However, the effects of the high stellar activity of M dwarf hosts has
uncertain effects on such planets, and may render them uninhabitable.
Studying stellar activity at M dwarfs is hindered by a lack of
measurements of high-energy radiation, flare activity and, in
particular, stellar wind rates. We propose to rectify this by observing
a sample of Post Common Envelope Binaries (PCEBs) with HST and XMM-
Newton. PCEBs consist of an M dwarf with a white dwarf companion, which
experiences the same stellar wind and radiation environment as a close-
in planet. The stellar wind of the M dwarf accretes onto the otherwise
pure hydrogen atmosphere white dwarf, producing metal lines detectable
with ultraviolet spectroscopy. The metal lines can be used to measure
accretion rates onto the white dwarf, from with we can accurately infer
the stellar wind mass loss rate of the M dwarf, along with abundances of
key elements. Simultaneous observations with XMM-Newton will probe X-ray
flare occurrence rate and strength, in addition to coronal temperatures.
Performing these measurements over twelve PCEBs will provide a sample of
M dwarf stellar wind strengths, flare occurrence and X-ray/UV activity
that will finally shed light on the true habitability of planets around
small stars.

Advanced LIGO and the positive results from LISA Pathfinder. In this
context, NASA has decided to partner with the ESA on their L3
gravitational wave observatory, whose science goals are outlined in the
white paper, The Gravitational Universe. The current launch date for L3
is 2034, but with the success of Pathfinder and the increased scientific
interest in gravitational waves caused by LIGO, ESA and its member
states are exploring ways to move up the launch date. In the U.S., the
National Academy's Astronomy Midterm Assessment has recommended that
NASA restore support for a gravitational wave mission in this decade
with the goal of realizing the full scientific capability of the mission
envisioned in the 2020 decadal. NASA has appointed the L3 Study Team,
charged with providing analysis of potential U.S. contributions to the
European-led L3 mission and preparing for the next decadal survey. The
LISA mission concept, proposed for L3, will improve our understanding of
the formation and growth of massive black holes, create a census of
compact binary systems in the Milky Way, test general relativity in
extreme conditions, provide predictions of black hole binary mergers in
the LIGO frequency band, and enable searches for new physics.

AB Modern data analysis methods such as photometric ubercalibration and
optimized mosaicing with background matching have enhanced the public
products of many large astronomical surveys, but unfortunately not yet
for the GALEX mission. This is significant because GALEX provided our
only view of the entire ultraviolet (UV) sky - a circumstance unlikely
to change for many years. We have recently achieved both these
calibration goals for a subset of the GALEX observations toward the
Magellanic Clouds, substantially increasing the quality and internal
consistency of the source catalogs and fidelity of the diffuse emission
morphology in this limited region. We propose to apply the same methods
to the entire public GALEX database, in order to eliminate remaining
discontinuities in the current photometry and step-like background
artifacts in sky maps. This work will have two principal products: (1)
the updated photometric catalog for all GALEX sources, and (2) a Legacy
all-sky coadd for both the FUV and NUV bands. Traditional GALEX pipeline
analysis only stacked exposures that were obtained as part of the same
planned survey tile. However, a substantial degree of overlap between
independent GALEX observations does exist and can used to produce a
deeper coadd over much of the sky. Redundant coverage also allows
artifacts such as internal reflections to be masked when stacking. Our
ADAP effort will ideally complement the all-sky unWISE reprocessing
project in infrared bands. We will publicly release all products as they
are produced. This project will positively impact both extragalactic and
Milky Way related science and is therefore relevant to a wide range of
NASA priorities.

AB Fiber optic networks are no longer just pipelines for transporting data
in the long haul backbone. Exponential growth in traffic in metro-
regional areas has pushed higher capacity fiber toward the edge of the
network, and highly dynamic patterns of heterogeneous traffic have
emerged that are often bursty, severely stressing the historical "fat
and dumb pipe" static optical network, which would need to be massively
over-provisioned to deal with these loads. What is required is a more
intelligent network with a span of control over the optical as well as
electrical transport mechanisms which enables handling of service
requests in a fast and efficient way that guarantees quality of service
(QoS) while optimizing capacity efficiency. An "agile" optical network
is a reconfigurable optical network comprised of high speed intelligent
control system fed by real-time in situ network sensing. It provides
fast response in the control and switching of optical signals in
response to changing traffic demands and network conditions. This agile
control of optical signals is enabled by pushing switching decisions
downward in the network stack to the physical layer. Implementing such
agility is challenging due to the response dynamics and interactions of
signals in the physical layer. Control schemes must deal with issues
such as dynamic power equalization, EDFA transients and cascaded noise
effects, impairments due to self-phase modulation and dispersion, and
channel-to-channel cross talk. If these issues are not properly
predicted and mitigated, attempts at dynamic control can drive the
optical network into an unstable state. In order to enable high speed
actuation of signal modulators and switches, the network controller must
be able to make decisions based on predictive models. In this thesis, we
consider how to take advantage of Software Defined Networking (SDN)
capabilities for network reconfiguration, combined with embedded models
that access updates from deployed network monitoring sensors. In order
to maintain signal quality while optimizing network resources, we find
that it is essential to model and update estimates of the physical link
impairments in real-time. In this thesis, we consider the key elements
required to enable an agile optical network, with contributions as
follows: ∙ Control Framework: extended the SDN concept to include the
optical transport network through extensions to the OpenFlow (OF)
protocol. A unified SDN control plane is built to facilitate control and
management capability across the electrical/packet-switched and optical
/circuit-switched portions of the network seamlessly. The SDN control
plane serves as a platform to abstract the resources of
multilayer/multivendor networks. Through this platform, applications can
dynamically request the network resources to meet their service
requirements. ∙ Use of In-situ Monitors: enabled real-time physical
impairment sensing in the control plane using in-situ Optical
Performance Monitoring (OPM) and bit error rate (BER) analyzers. OPM and
BER values are used as quantitative indicators of the link status and
are fed to the control plane through a high-speed data collection
interface to form a closed-loop feedback system to enable adaptive
resource allocation. ∙ Predictive Network Model: used a network model
embedded in the control layer to study the link status. The estimated
results of network status is fed into the control decisions to
precompute the network resources. The performance of the network model
can be enhanced by the sensing results. ∙ Real-Time Control Algorithms:
investigated various dynamic resource allocation mechanisms supporting
an agile optical network. Intelligent routing and wavelength switching
for recovering from traffic impairments is achieved experimentally in
the agile optical network within one second. A distance-adaptive
spectrum allocation scheme to address transmission impairments caused by
cascaded Wavelength Selective Switches (WSS) is proposed and evaluated
for improving network spectral efficiency.

AB Coronal holes are where the fast solar wind streams out of the Suns
atmosphere, sending charged particles on rapid trajectories out into the
solar system. A new study examines how the distribution of coronal holes
has changed over the last 40 years.Coronal holes form where magnetic
field lines open into space (B) instead of looping back to the solar
surface (A). [Sebman81]Source of the Fast Solar WindAs a part of the
Suns natural activity cycle, extremely low-density regions sometimes
form in the solar corona. These coronal holes manifest themselves as
dark patches in X-ray and extreme ultraviolet imaging, since the corona
is much hotter than the solar surface that peeks through from underneath
it.Coronal holes form when magnetic field lines open into space instead
of looping back to the solar surface. In these regions, the solar
atmosphere escapes via these field lines, rapidly streaming away from
the Suns surface in whats known as the fast solar wind.Coronal Holes
Over Space and TimeAutomated detection of coronal holes from image-based
analysis is notoriously difficult. Recently, a team of scientists led by
Kenichi Fujiki (ISEE, Nagoya University, Japan) has developed an
automated prediction technique for coronal holes that relies instead on
magnetic-field data for the Sun, obtained at the National Solar
Observatorys Kitt Peak between 1975 and 2014. The team used these data
to produce a database of 3335 coronal hole predictions over nearly 40
years.Latitude distribution of 2870 coronal holes (each marked by an x;
color indicates polarity), overlaid on the magnetic butterfly map of the
Sun. The low-latitude coronal holes display a similar butterfly pattern,
in which they move closer to the equator over the course of the solar
cycle. Polar coronal holes are more frequent during solar minima.
[Fujiki et al. 2016]Examining trends in the coronal holes distribution
in latitude and time, Fujiki and collaborators find a strong correlation
between the total area covered by low-latitude coronal holes (holes
closer to the Suns equator) and sunspot activity. In contrast, the total
area of high-latitude coronal holes (those near the Suns poles) peaks
around the minimum in each solar cycle and shrinks around each solar
maximum.Predicting the Impact of the Solar WindWhy do these observations
matter? Coronal holes are the source of the fast solar wind, so if we
can better predict the frequency and locations of coronal holes in the
future, we can make better predictions about how the solar wind might
impact us here on Earth.Periodicity of high-latitude (orange) and low-
latitude (blue) coronal-hole areas, and periodicity of galactic cosmic
rays detected at Earth (black). The cosmic rays track the polar coronal-
hole area behavior with a 1-year time lag. [Fujiki et al. 2016]In one
example of this, Fujiki and collaborators show that theres a distinct
correlation between polar coronal-hole area and observed galactic cosmic
rays. Cosmic rays from within our galaxy have long been known to exhibit
a 22-year periodicity. Fujiki and collaborators show that the
periodicity of the galactic cosmic-ray activity tracks that of the polar
coronal-hole area, with a ~1-year lag time which is equivalent to the
propagation time of the solar wind to the termination shock.Polar
coronal holes are therefore a useful observable indicator of the dipole
component of the solar magnetic field, which modulates the incoming
cosmic rays entering our solar system. This coronal hole database will
be a useful tool for understanding the source of solar wind and the many
ways the wind influences the Earth and our solar system.CitationK.

AB A systematic inspection of the far-infrared (FIR) properties of evolved
stars allows not only to constrain physical models, but also to
understand the chemical evolution that takes place in the end of their
lives. In this work we intend to study the circumstellar envelopes (CSE)
on a sample of stars in the THROES catalogue from AGB/post-AGB stars to
planetary nebulae using photometry and spectroscopy provided by the PACS
instrument on-board Herschel telescope. In the first part we are
interested in obtaining an estimate of the size of FIR emitting region
and to sort our targets in two classes: point-like and extended.
Secondly, we focus on the molecular component of the envelope traced by
carbon monoxide (CO) rotational lines. We conduct a line survey on a
sample of evolved stars by identifying and measuring flux of both 12CO
and 13CO isotopologues in the PACS range, while looking at the overall
properties of the sample. Lastly, we will be interested in obtaining
physical parameters of the CSE, namely gas temperature, mass and mass-
loss rate on a sample of carbon stars. For that, we make use of PACS
large wavelength coverage, which enables the simultaneous study of a
large number of CO transitions, to perform the rotational diagram
analysis. We report the detection of CO emission in a high number of
stars from the catalogue, which were mostly classified as point-like
targets with a few exceptions of planetary nebulae. High J rotational
number transitions were detected in a number of targets, revealing the
presence of a significant amount of hot gas (T ̃ 400-900 K) and high
mass-loss rates. We conclude that Herschel/PACS is in a privileged
position to detect a new population of warmer gas, typically missed in
sub-mm/mm observations.

Cyg very closely and report your observations to the AAVSO via WebObs at
once. It is likely to go into outburst very soon, and immediate
reporting of outburst behavior is crucial to the success of the

colleagues have been very successful. AAVSO observations are used to
trigger multi-site radio observations of SS Cyg in research on radio
emission from this dwarf nova, as well as for correlation with the radio
data during analysis. Visual and CCD/DSLR (particularly V) observations
are requested (no time series unless outburst is underway and radio
observations have been triggered). Its normal minimum magnitude is 11.8
V, but it can fluctuate to around 11.5. If it becomes brighter than 11.5
V, it could well be going into outburst. If it reaches 11.0, it is
almost certainly on its way up. Please report your observations of SS
Cyg to the AAVSO as soon after you make them as possible. If you see it
11.5 or brighter, please report them immediately. Finder charts with
sequence may be created using the AAVSO Variable Star Plotter
(https://www.aavso.org/vsp). Observations should be submitted to the
AAVSO International Database. See full Special Notice for more details.

AB Two research endeavors are described in this dissertation; both
undertake problems in solid-state astrophysics, which is a branch of
solid-state physics concerning the extreme conditions found within white
dwarfs and the solid crusts of neutron stars. As much of our knowledge
about these compact objects comes from observation of astrophysical
phenomena, Chapter 1 is devoted to the phenomena, and how they can be
exploited as material property probes. Several of the most interesting
phenomena involve the enormous magnetic fields (B ≥ 1012 gauss) harbored
by many neutron stars, and the interaction between these fields and the
charged particles within the solid crust. Accordingly, Chapter 2 reviews
some theory of strongly-magnetized electrons, which both sets the stage
for Chapter 3, and (hopefully) serves as a useful reference for future
research. Let it now be made clear that this dissertation focuses
exclusively on the "outer crusts," of neutron stars, where no free
neutrons are present (rho < 4x1011 g/cc), and the similarly-composed
interiors of white dwarfs, which have central densities ̃ 107 g/cc. For
the most part we specialize to even lower densities. In Chapter 3,
static and dynamic properties of low density (rho ≥ 106 g/cc) outer
envelopes of neutron stars are calculated within the nonlinear magnetic
Thomas-Fermi model, assuming degenerate electrons. A novel domain
decomposition enables proper description of lattice symmetry and may be
seen as a prototype for the general class of problems involving
nonlinear charge screening of periodic, quasi-low-dimensionality
structures, e.g. liquid crystals. We describe a scalable implementation
of the method using Hypre. Over the density range considered, the
effective shear modulus appears to be a factor of ≈ 20 larger than in
the linearlyscreened Coulomb crystal model, which could have
implications for observables related to astroseismology as well as low
temperature phonon-mediated thermal conductivity. Other findings include
incipient c' < 0 elastic instabilities for both bcc and fcc lattices,
reminiscent of the situation in some light actinides, and suggestive of
a symmetry-lowering transition to a tetragonal or orthorhombic lattice.
Chapter 4 describes a systematic search for multicomponent crystal
structures, carried out for five different ternary systems of nuclei in
a polarizable background of electrons, representative of accreted
neutron star crusts and some white dwarfs. Candidate structures are
"bred" by a genetic algorithm, and optimized at constant pressure under
the assumption of linear response (Thomas-Fermi) charge screening.
Subsequent phase equilibria calculations reveal eight distinct crystal
structures in the T = 0 bulk phase diagrams, five of which are
complicated multinary structures not before predicted in the context of
compact object astrophysics. Frequent instances of geometrically similar
but compositionally distinct phases give insight into structural
preferences of systems with pairwise Yukawa interactions, including and
extending to the regime of low density colloidal suspensions made in a
laboratory. As an application of these main results, we self-
consistently couple the phase stability problem to the equations for a
self-gravitating, hydrostatically stable white dwarf, with fixed overall
composition. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to incorporate
complex multinary phases into the equilibrium phase layering diagram and
mass-radius-composition dependence, both of which are reported for
He-C-O and C-O-Ne white dwarfs. Finite thickness interfacial phases
("interphases") show up at the boundaries between single-component bcc
crystalline regions, some of which have lower lattice symmetry than
cubic. A second application---quasi-static settling of heavy nuclei in
white dwarfs---builds on our equilibrium phase layering method. Tests of
this nonequilibrium method reveal extra phases which play the role of
transient host phases for the settling species.

AB Did you know that the very first exoplanets ever confirmed were found
around a pulsar? The precise timing measurements of pulsar PSR 1257+12
were what made the discovery of its planetary companions possible. Yet
surprisingly, though weve discovered thousands of exoplanets since then,
only one other planet has ever been confirmed around a pulsar. Now, a
team of CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science researchers are trying to
figure out why.Formation ChallengesThe lack of detected pulsar planets
may simply reflect the fact that getting a pulsar-planet system is
challenging! There are three main pathways:The planet formed before the
host star became a pulsar which means it somehow survived its star going
supernova (yikes!).The planet formed elsewhere and was captured by the
pulsar.The planet formed out of the debris of the supernova
explosion.The first two options, if even possible, are likely to be rare
occurrences but the third option shows some promise. In this scenario,
after the supernova explosion, a small fraction of the material falls
back toward the stellar remnant and is recaptured, forming what is known
as a supernova fallback disk. According to this model, planets could
potentially form out of this disk.Disk ImplicationsLed by Matthew Kerr,
the CSIRO astronomers set out to systematically look for these potential
planets that might have formed in situ around pulsars. They searched a
sample of 151 young, energetic pulsars, scouring seven years of pulse
time-of-arrival data for periodic variation that could signal the
presence of planetary companions. Their methods to mitigate pulsar
timing noise and model realistic orbits allowed them to have good
sensitivity to low-mass planets.The results? They found no conclusive
evidence that any of these pulsars have planets.This outcome carries
with it some significant implications. The pulsar sample spans 2 Myr in
age, in which planets should have had enough time to form in debris
disks. The fact that none were detected suggests that long-lived
supernova fallback disks may actually be much rarer than thought, or
they exist only in conditions that arent compatible with planet
formation.So if thats the case, what about the planets found around PSR
1257+12? This pulsar may actually be somewhat unique, in that it was
born with an unusually weak magnetic field. This birth defect might have
allowed it to form a fallback disk and, subsequently, planets where the
sample of energetic pulsars studied here could not.CitationM. Kerr et

AB The ability to detect small and localized movements of geotechnical
facilities is important for performance monitoring and early-warning
hazard detection. Current deformation monitoring technology is limited
in its ability to both scan massive structures and detect small and
localized movements. Ground-based interferometric radar (GBIR) is an
emerging remote sensing technology that has the potential to fill this
gap in surface deformation monitoring technology. Much of the focus of
previous research and application of GBIR has been on monitoring large
spatial scale movements, such as mine walls, dams, and earth slopes
experiencing deformational movements occurring over hundreds or
thousands of square meters. In this study the focus is on evaluating the
capabilities of GBIR for detecting and monitoring small movements (mm-
scale) occurring over very localized regions (a few m2). Specifically,
this study focused on the application of GBIR for detecting and
monitoring movements of individual boulders in a massive landscape. The
potential long-term application is to use GBIR to detect and monitor
precursor movements to rockfall events. Boulders, ranging from 0.5 to 5
meters in approximate facial dimensions, were moved using pry bars and
airbag jacks in increments of a few to several mm. Two identical GBIR
devices positioned at separate locations scanned a region covering
approximately 20,000 m2 after each boulder movement. Ground truth
measurements were also performed after each boulder movement. The
detectability of the boulder movements was assessed by comparing the
distribution of measured phase values from the boulder to (1) phase
values measured on the surrounding non-moving portion of the image and
(2) phase values measured from the same boulder when it was not moving.
The results from the study showed that movements of boulders with
dimensions larger than about 2 m were detectable for range offset
distances from about 75 to 150 m. Movements as small of 1.7 mm were
detected on these larger boulders. Phase values associated with
movements of the smaller boulders, with dimensions less than about 2 m,
were more difficult to differentiate from the non-moving portions of the
image. This study successfully demonstrated the potential of GBIR to
fill existing gaps in current displacement and deformation monitoring
technology for geotechnical applications.

galaxies at z~1 are no different from those of inactive galaxies once
stellar mass selection effects are taken into account. However, there is
a clear deficit of AGN among quiescent galaxies, and the average star
formation rates of AGN hosts are comparable or higher than those of
inactive star-forming galaxies. These apparently contradictory findings
could be a consequence of higher extinction in star-forming AGN hosts
compensating for their younger stellar populations in observed colours.
In this talk I will present a new method of extinction correction that
breaks the degeneracy with stellar age and metallicity by comparing the
restframe U-V colour with measurements of the Dn(4000) index on
intermediate band photospectra from SHARDS. I'll show that the
distribution of extinction corrected U-V colours and Dn(4000) for AGN
hosts at z<1 is significantly different from that of comparison samples
of inactive galaxies, with a clear deficit of AGN in intrinsic red
galaxies and a higher prevalence among those with intermediate age
stellar populations.

AB SUPERBOX is a particle-mesh code that uses moving sub-grids to track and
resolve high-density peaks in the particle distribution and a nearest
grid point force-calculation scheme based on the second derivatives of
the potential. The code implements a fast low-storage FFT-algorithm and
allows a highly resolved treatment of interactions in clusters of
galaxies, such as high-velocity encounters between elliptical galaxies
and the tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies, as sub-grids follow the
trajectories of individual galaxies. SUPERBOX is efficient in that the
computational overhead is kept as slim as possible and is also memory
efficient since it uses only one set of grids to treat galaxies in
succession.

AB The Low Frequency All Sky Monitor (LoFASM) is a distributed array of
dipole antennas that are sensitive to radio frequencies from 10 to 88
MHz. The primary science goals of LoFASM are the detection and study of
low-frequency radio transients, a high priority science goal as deemed
by the National Research Council's decadal survey. LoFASM consists of
antennas and front-end electronics that were originally developed for
the Long Wavelength Array (LWA) by the U.S. Naval Research Lab, the
University of New Mexico, Virginia Tech, and the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory. LoFASM, funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, will
initially consist of four stations, each consisting of 12 dual-
polarization dipole antennas. In a single station, RF signals from each
of the individual LoFASM dipoles are combined in phase in order to
synthesize LoFASM's beam. The LoFASM RF signals are phased up so that
the resulting beam is sensitive to radio emission that originates from
the zenith and RF signals approaching from the horizon are attenuated.
Digitally, this is achieved using a full Stokes 100MHz correlating
spectrometer constructed using field programmable gate array (FPGA)
technology. In this thesis I will describe the design and usage of the
LoFASM Correlator.

AB  - Accurate flux calibration for the STIS echelle modes is heavily
dependent on the proper alignment of the blaze function for each
spectral order. However, due to changes in the instrument alignment over
time and between exposures, the blaze function can shift in wavelength.
This may result in flux calibration inconsistencies of up to 10%. We
present the stisblazefix Python module as a tool for STIS users to
correct their echelle spectra. The stisblazefix module assumes that the
error in the blaze alignment is a linear function of spectral order, and
finds the set of shifts that minimizes the flux inconsistencies in the
overlap between spectral orders. We discuss the uses and limitations of
this tool, and show that its use can provide significant improvements to
the default pipeline flux calibration for many observations.

AB  - The fluxes of <SUP>3</SUP>He, <SUP>4</SUP>He, C, O, and Fe ions at low
energies (about 0.04 - 2 MeV/nucleon) are studied during quiet periods
in Solar Cycles (SC) 23 and 24 using data from the ULEIS/ACE instrument.
In selecting quiet periods (the definition is given in Section 2.1),
additional data from EPHIN/SOHO and EPAM/ACE were also used. The
analysis of the ion energy spectra and their relative abundances shows
that their behavior is governed by their first-ionization potential.
Substantial differences in the ion energy spectra in two consecutive
solar cycles are observed during the quiet periods selected. Quiet-time
fluxes are divided into three distinct types according to the {̃} 80 -
320 keV/nucleon Fe/O ratio. Our results confirm the earlier observation
that these types of suprathermal particles have different origins, that
is, they represent different seed populations that are accelerated by
different processes. Except for the solar activity minimum, the Fe/O
ratio during quiet-time periods correspond either to the abundances of
ions in particle fluxes accelerated in impulsive solar flares or to the
mean abundances of elements in the solar corona. At the activity
minimum, this ratio takes on values that are characteristic for the
solar wind. These results indicate that the background fluxes of low-
energy particles in the ascending, maximum, and decay phases of the
solar cycle include significant contributions from both coronal
particles accelerated to suprathermal energies and ions accelerated in
small impulsive solar flares rich in Fe, while the contribution of
remnants from earlier SEP events cannot be excluded. The comparison of
suprathermal ion abundances during the first five years of SC 23 and SC
24 suggests that the quiet-time and non-quiet fluxes of Fe and
<SUP>3</SUP>He were lower in SC 24.

spectroscopic binary stars identified by the Geneva-Copenhagen
spectroscopic survey with the SOAR 4m telescope + HRCam. These systems
represent our best chance to take advantage of Gaia parallaxes for the
purpose of stellar mass determinations. Many of these systems already
have mass fractions (although generally no spectroscopic orbit - an
astrometric orbit will determine individual masses), metallicity
information, and Hipparcos distances. They will be used to improve our
knowledge of the mass-luminosity relation, particularly for lower-
metallicity stars. Our survey will create the first all-sky, volume-
limited, speckle archive for the two primary samples, complementing a
similar effort that has been recently been completed at the WIYN 3.5-m
telescope in the Northern Hemisphere. This extension to the Southern
Hemisphere will fill out the picture for a wider metallicity range.

positive cosmological constant. We also show that without a cosmological
constant asymptotically flat solutions cannot possess a degenerate

follows easily from differential geometry in the near-horizon limit,
while others use Bakry-Émery-Ricci bounds for static Einstein manifolds.

AB  - Due to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration and its effect on global
climates, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
proposes a Clean Power Plan (CPP) mandating CO2 reductions which will
likely force the early retirement of inefficient, aging power plants.
Consequentially, removing these plants equates to a shortfall of
approximately 66 GW of electricity. These factors add to the looming
resource problems of choosing whether to build large replacement power
plants or consider alternative energy sources as a means to help close
the gap between electricity supply and demand in a given region. One
energy source, shallow water tidal currents, represents opportunities to
convert kinetic energy to mechanical forms and provide electricity to
homes and businesses. Nearly 2,000 National Oceanic Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) tidal current data points from Maine to Texas are
considered. This paper, based on systems engineering thinking, provides
key attributes (e.g. turbine efficiency, array size, transmission
losses) for consideration as decision makers seek to identify where to
site Marine Hydrokinetic (MHK) systems and the number of homes powered
by the practical harvest of electricity from tidal currents at those
locations with given attributes. A systems engineering process model is
proposed for consideration as is a regression based equation to estimate
MHK machine parameters needed for power a given number of homes.

galaxy cluster 1RXS J0603.3+4214, known as the Toothbrush cluster due to
the shape of its most prominent radio relic. Featured in a recent

observations (red) showing the radio emission within the cluster. This
is composited with a Chandra view of the X-ray emitting gas of the

The new deep VLA data totaling 26 hours of observations provides a
detailed look at the complex structure within the Toothbrush relic,
revealing enigmatic filaments and twists (see below). This new data will
help us to explore the possible merger history of this cluster, which is
theorized to have caused the unusual shapes we see today. For more

AB  - The observed evolution of the broad-band spectral energy distribution
(SED) in NS X-ray Nova Aql X-1 during the rise phase of a bright Fast-
Rise-Exponential-Decay-type outburst in 2013 can be understood in the
framework of thermal emission from non-stationary accretion disc with
radial temperature distribution transforming from a single-temperature
blackbody emitting ring into the multicolour irradiated accretion disc.
SED evolution during the hard to soft X-ray state transition looks
unusual, as it cannot be reproduced by the standard disc irradiation
model with a single irradiation parameter for NUV, Optical and NIR
spectral bands. NIR (NUV) band is correlated with soft (hard) X-ray flux
changes during the state transition interval, respectively. In our
interpretation, at the moment of X-ray state transition UV-emitting
parts of the accretion disc are screened from direct X-ray illumination
from the central source and are heated primarily by hard X-rays (E > 10
keV), scattered in the hot corona or wind possibly formed above the
optically thick outer accretion flow; the outer edge of multicolour
disc, which emits in Optical-NIR, can be heated primarily by direct
X-ray illumination. We point out that future simultaneous
multiwavelength observations of X-ray Nova systems during the fast X-ray
state transition interval are of great importance, as it can serve as
'X-ray tomograph' to study physical conditions in outer regions of
accretion flow. This can provide an effective tool to directly test the
energy-dependent X-ray heating efficiency, vertical structure and
accretion flow geometry in transient low-mass X-ray binaries.

AB  - The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover carries a suite of
meteorological detectors that constitute the Rover Environmental
Monitoring Station (REMS) instrument. REMS investigates the
meteorological conditions at Gale crater by obtaining high-frequency
data of pressure, air and ground temperature, relative humidity, UV flux
at the surface and wind intensity and direction with some limitations in
the wind data. We have run a search of atmospheric pressure drops of
short duration (< 25 s) and we present a statistical study of the
frequency of these events in the REMS pressure data during its first
1417 sols (more than two Martian years). The identified daytime pressure
drops could be caused by the close passages of warm vortices and dust
devils. Previous systematic searches of warm vortices from REMS pressure
data (Kahanpää et al., 2016; Steakley and Murphy, 2016) cover about one
Martian year. We show that sudden pressure drops are twice more abundant
in the second Martian year [sols 671-1339] than in the first one
analyzed in previous works. The higher number of detections could be
linked to a combination of different topography, higher altitudes (120 m
above the landing site) and true inter-annual meteorological
variability. We found 1129 events with a pressure drop larger than 0.5
Pa. Of these, 635 occurred during the local daytime (∼56%) and 494 were
nocturnal. The most intense pressure drop (4.2 Pa) occurred at daytime
on sol 1417 (areocentric solar longitude L<SUB>s</SUB> = 195°) and was
accompanied by a simultaneous decrease in the UV signal of 7.1%,
pointing to a true dust devil. We also discuss similar but less intense
simultaneous pressure and UV radiation drops that constitute 0.7% of all
daytime events. Most of the intense daytime pressure drops with
variations larger than 1.0 Pa occur when the difference between air and
ground temperature is larger than 15 K. Statistically, the frequency of
daytime pressure drops peaks close to noon (12:00-13:00 Local True Solar
Time or LTST) with more events in spring and summer (L<SUB>s</SUB> from
180° to 360°). The nocturnal sudden pressure drops concentrate in the
20:00-23:00 LTST time interval and they only occur in spring and summer.
We interpret these nocturnal events as a consequence of local
mechanically forced turbulence. This interpretation is consistent with
published results from simulations with the MRAMS model (Rafkin et al.,
2016) that predict a competition between local orographic circulation
and global Hadley cell circulation at Gale crater at summer night-time
that can enhance forced turbulence at the surface. Bursts of pressure
drops appear on particular sols, especially at night-time. Most of the
vortex bursts occurred when MSL was in the region called Pahrump Hills
characterized by a complex terrain. A comparison of the daytime pressure
drops from REMS data with published results from the Pathfinder and
Phoenix missions shows that the frequency of daytime events at Gale
crater in spring and summer is similar to the one previously found at
other locations. Finally, we present possible correlations between MSL
activity and some daytime pressure drops. If such an instrumental effect
is present in the REMS data its impact in this analysis is small and
would only affect about 7% of our detections.

model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ is a finitary factor of a finite-valued i.i.d.
process. We strengthen this by showing that the factor map can be made
to have finite expected coding volume (in fact, stretch-exponential
tails), answering a question of van den Berg and Steif. The result holds
at any temperature above the critical temperature. An analogous result
holds for Markov random fields satisfying a high-noise assumption and
for proper colorings with a large number of colors.

AB  - This work is the first study on the 3D shape of starbursting extremely
metal-poor galaxies (XMPs; a galaxy is said to be an XMP if its ionized
gas-phase metallicity is less than 1/10 the solar value). A few hundred
XMPs have been identified in the local universe primarily through mining
the spectroscopic catalog of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and
follow-up observations have shown that metallicity drops significantly
at the starburst (compared to the quiescent component of the galaxy). As
the timescale for gas mixing is short, the metal-poor gas triggering the
starburst must have been accreted recently. This is strong observational
evidence for the cold flow accretion predicted by cosmological models of
galaxy formation, and, in this respect, XMPs seem to be the best local
analogs of the very first galaxies.The ellipsoidal shape of a class of
galaxies can be inferred from the observed axial ratio (q) distribution
(q = minor axis/major axis) of a large sample of randomly-oriented
galaxies. Fitting ellipses to 200 XMPs using r-band SDSS images, we
observe that the axial ratio distribution falls off at q < ~0.4 and q >
~0.8, and we determine that these falloffs are not due to biases in the
data. The falloff at low axial ratio indicates that the XMPs are thick
for their size, and the falloff at high axial ratio suggests the vast
majority of XMPs are triaxial. We also observe that smaller XMPs are
thicker in proportion to their size, and it is expected that for
decreasing galaxy size the ratio of random to rotational motions
increases, which correlates with increasing relative thickness. The XMPs
are low-redshift dwarf galaxies dominated by dark matter, and our
results are compatible with simulations that have shown dark matter
halos to be triaxial, with triaxial stellar distributions for low-mass
galaxies and with triaxiality increasing over time. We will offer
precise constraints on the 3D shape of XMPs via Bayesian analysis of our
observed axial ratio distribution.This work has been supported by the La
Caixa Foundation and the Estallidos Spanish Ministry of Science and
Innovation grant.

AB  - Studies in the last 10 years of dust formation in core-collapse
supernovae (CCSNe) have found only small amounts, 0.001 solar masses.
This is far less than the amount needed to account for the large masses
of dust seen in some high redshift galaxies. However, the recent
discovery of 1 solar mass of cold dust in the ejecta of SN 1987A has has
caused a complete re-evaluation of dust formation in CCSNe. It has been
suggested that the CCSNe are continuously forming dust so that by the
time they are about 25 years old they will have dust masses similar to
SN 1987A. However, there is a wide time gap between the CCSNe that have
been studied recently and SN 1987A. We plan to use the sensitivity of
Spitzer to detect dust emission from SN 2017eaw at two epochs less than
a year after explosion. Radiative transfer models will be used to
estimate the dust masses. These observations will provide a necessary
baseline for our proposed JWST DD ERS observations. This is part of a
long term study to look for evidence of continuous dust formation in
CCSNe. These observations will help shed light on the mystery of dust in
the early universe. SSC Note: A 2019 epoch was added by the TAC.

AB  - We investigate the scaling properties of EUV intensity fluctuations seen
in low-latitude coronal holes (CH) and in regions of Quiet Sun (QS), in
signals obtained with the SDO/AIA instrument in the 193 Å waveband.
Contemporaneous time series in the 171 and 211 Å wavebands are used for
comparison among emissions at different heights in the transition region
and low corona. Potential-field extrapolations of contemporaneous
SDO/HMI line-of-sight magnetic fields provide a context in the physical
environment. Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) shows that the
variance of the fluctuations obeys a power-law as a function of temporal
scales with periods in the range ~15-60 min. This scaling is
characterized by a generalized Hurst exponent α. In QS regions, and in
regions within CHs that include magnetic bipoles, the scaling exponent
lies in the range 1.0 < α < 1.5, and it thus corresponds to anti-
correlated, turbulent-like, dynamical processes. Regions inside the
coronal holes primarily associated with magnetic field of a dominant
single polarity, have a generalized exponent (0.5 < α < 1) corresponding
to positively correlated (“persistent”) processes. The results indicate
the influence of the magnetic fields on the dynamics of the emission.

AB  - Flares are thought to be sudden releases of magnetic energy stored
around starspots. Recent space high-precision photometry shows
“superflares”, 10-10<SUP>4</SUP> times more energetic than the largest
solar flares, occur on many G, K, M-type stars (e.g., Maehara+2012
Nature). Harmful UV/X-ray radiation and high-energy particles such as
protons are caused by such superflares. This may suggest that exoplanet
host stars have severe effects on the physical and chemical evolution of
exoplanetary atmospheres (cf. Segura+2010 Astrobiology, Takahashi+2016
ApJL).We here present statistical properties of superflares on G, K,
M-type stars on the basis of our analyses of Kepler photometric data
(Maehara+2012 Nature, Shibayama+2013 ApJS, Notsu+2013 ApJ,
Canderaresi+2014 ApJ, Maehara+2015 EPS, Maehara+2017 PASJ). We found
more than 5000 superflares on 800 G, K, M-type main-sequence stars, and
the occurrence frequency (dN/dE) of superflares as a function of flare
energy (E) shows the power-law distribution with the index of -1.8 -1.9.
This power-law distribution is consistent with that of solar
flares.Flare frequency increases as stellar temperature decreases. As
for M-type stars, energy of the largest flares is smaller compared with
G,K-type stars, but more frequent “hazardous” flares for the habitable
planets since the habitable zone around M-type stars is much smaller
compared with G, K-type stars.Rotation period and starspot coverage can
be estimated from the quasi-periodic brightness variation of the
superflare stars. The intensity of Ca II 8542 line of superflare stars,
which is measured from spectroscopic observations with Subaru Telescope,
has a well correlation with the brightness variation amplitude
(Notsu+2015a&b PASJ).Flare frequency has a correlation with rotation
period, and this suggests young rapidly-rotating stars (like “young
Sun”) have more severe impacts of flares on the planetary atmosphere
(cf. Airapetian+2016 ApJL). Flare energy and frequency also depends on
starspot coverage, and this suggests existence of large starspots is
important factor of superflares.These statistical properties of
superflares discussed here can be one of the basic information for
considering the impacts of flares on planet-host stars.

AB  - Different groups of meteorites have distinctive isotopic compositions.
In a 2011 paper, Paul Warren (University of California, Los Angeles)
showed that there is a clear dichotomy in chromium and titanium isotopic
compositions between carbonaceous chondrites and all the other types of
stony meteorites, plus Earth, Moon, and Mars. Thomas Kruijer (Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, California and University of Münster,
Germany) and colleagues at the University of Münster now show that the
dichotomy involves iron meteorites as well as rocky ones. The two
distinct groups were nicknamed the CC (those with isotopes like
carbonaceous chondrites) and NC (those with isotopes like non-
carbonaceous meteorites). Kruijer and colleagues were able to determine
the time of core formation in the planetesimals in which iron meteorites
formed and report that CC iron meteorites formed 2.2 to 2.8 million
years after CAI formation, whereas the NC iron meteorites formed
earlier, before 1.8 million years after CAIs. (CAIs, calcium-aluminum-
rich inclusions, are the first solids to form in the Solar System and
give us a time-zero reference marker.) The accretion of the
planetesimals preceded core formation. Thermal calculations done by
Kruijer and colleagues indicate that NC objects accreted at 0.4 million
years after CAIs. In contrast, the CC objects accreted at 0.9 million
years after CAIs. Kruijer and colleagues suggest on the basis of their
results and published models for the formation of Jupiter that the
dichotomy resulted from Jupiter's formation. The NC materials accreted
when there was a continuous gas disk characterized by solids flowing
inwards towards the Sun. However, less than a million years later,
something interrupted this continuous flow, leading to formation of the
isotopic dichotomy. Kruijer and coworkers suggest that rapid accretion
of Jupiter's solid, mostly rocky core was the event that disrupted the
continuous inwards flow. Models suggest that Jupiter would have grown to
about 20 Earth masses, after which it grew by accreting gases to it. The
ages of the NC and CC iron meteorite groups indicate that Jupiter's
rocky core formed about 1 million years after CAIs. Sophisticated models
for planetary accretion predict early formation of the rocky core of
Jupiter, but suggest this process took between 1 and 10 million years
(after CAIs). Quantitative meteorite data show that the time was around
a million years, providing useful input for improving the models and
showing the value of combining theory with data on ancient samples.

AB  - Fluctuations are one of the main probes of the physics of the new state
of hot and dense nuclear matter called the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP)
which is created in the ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. In this
dissertation we extend and improve upon the existing descriptions of
heavy ion collisions in three different directions: we study the new
signatures of initial state fluctuations, the propagation of
perturbations in the early stages of the collision, and the effect of
thermal fluctuations on the hydrodynamic expansion of the QGP. First, in
Chapter 3 we study initial state fluctuations by examining the complete
statistical information contained in the two-particle correlation
measurements in hydrodynamic simulations of Pb+Pb collisions at the CERN
Large Hadron Collider (√sNN = 2.76 TeV). We use Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) to decompose the spectrum of harmonic flow, v_n(p_T) for
n = 0-5, into dominant components. The leading component is identified
with the standard event plane vn(pT), while the subleading component
describes additional fluctuations in the two-particle correlation
function. We find good geometric predictors for the orientation and the
magnitude of the leading and the subleading flows. The subleading v 0,
v1, and v3 flow harmonics are shown to be a response to the radial
excitation of the corresponding eccentricity epsilonn. In contrast, for
v2 the subleading flow in peripheral collisions is dominated by the
nonlinear mixing between the leading elliptic flow and radial flow
fluctuations. Nonlinear mixing also plays a significant role in
generating subleading v4 and v 5 harmonics. The PCA gives a systematic
way of studying the full information of the two-particle correlation
matrix and identifying the subleading flows, which we show are
responsible for factorization breaking in hydrodynamics. Second, in
Chapter 4 we study the thermalization and hydrodynamization of
fluctuations at the early stages of heavy ion collisions. We use leading
order effective kinetic theory, accurate at weak coupling, to simulate
the pre-equilibrium evolution of transverse energy and flow
perturbations. For the short evolution we can use a linear response
theory to construct the pre-equilibrium Green functions. Then the
energy-momentum tensor at a time when hydrodynamics becomes applicable
can be expressed as a linear convolution of response functions with the
initial perturbations. We propose combining effective kinetic theory
with weak coupling initial state models, such as IP-Glasma, to model the
complete pre-thermal evolution from saturated nuclei to hydrodynamics in
a weak coupling framework. Last, in Chapter 5 we consider out-of-
equilibrium hydrodynamic fluctuations in the expanding QGP. We develop a
set of kinetic equations for a correlator of thermal fluctuations which
are equivalent to nonlinear hydrodynamics with noise. We first show that
the kinetic response precisely reproduces the one-loop renormalization
of the shear viscosity for a static fluid. We then use the hydro-kinetic
equations to analyze thermal fluctuations for a Bjorken expansion. The
steady state solution to the kinetic equations determine the coefficient
of the first fractional power of the gradient expansion (infinity 1/(tau
T)3/2), which was computed here for the first time. The formalism of
hydro-kinetic equations can be applied to more general background flows
and coupled to existing viscous hydrodynamic codes to incorporate the
physics of hydrodynamic fluctuations.

AB  - How do magnetic fields form and evolve in early galaxies? A new study
has provided some clever observations to help us answer this
question.The Puzzle of Growing FieldsDynamo theory is the primary model
describing how magnetic fields develop in galaxies. In this picture,
magnetic fields start out as weak seed fields that are small and
unordered. These fields then become ordered and amplified by large-scale
rotation and turbulence in galaxy disks and halos, eventually leading to
the magnetic fields we observe in galaxies today.Schematic showinghow to
indirectly measure protogalactic magnetic fields. The measured
polarization of a background quasar is altered by the fields in a
foreground protogalaxy. Click for a closer look! [Farnes et al.
2017/Adolf Schaller/STSCI/NRAO/AUI/NSF]To test this model, we need
observations of the magnetic fields in young protogalaxies.
Unfortunately, we dont have the sensitivity to be able to measure these
fields directly but a team of scientists led by Jamie Farnes (Radboud
University in the Netherlands) have come up with a creative
alternative.The key is to find early protogalaxies that absorb the light
of more distant background objects. If a protogalaxy lies between us and
a distant quasar, then magnetic fields of the protogalaxy if present
will affect the polarization measurements of the background
quasar.Observing Galactic Building BlocksTop: Redshift distribution for
the background quasars in the authors sample. Bottom: Redshift
distribution for the foreground protogalaxies the authors are exploring.
[Farnes et al. 2017]Farnes and collaborators examined two types of
foreground protogalaxies: Damped Lyman-Alpha Absorbers (DLAs) and Lyman
Limit Systems (LLSs). They obtained polarimetric data for a sample of
114 distant quasars with nothing in the foreground (the control sample),
19 quasars with DLAs in the foreground, and 27 quasars with LLSs in the
foreground. They then used statistical analysis techniques to draw
conclusions about the magnetic fields in the foreground
protogalaxies.Farnes and collaborators were unable to detect either
coherent or random magnetic fields in DLAs. LLSs, however, showed some
evidence of coherent magnetic fields and significant evidence of
incoherent magnetic fields. The observations show that the magnetized
gas in LLSs must be highly turbulent on a scale of 520 parsecs similar
to turbulence scales in the Milky Way.Support for DynamosWhat do these
observations imply? Both support the dynamo theory of magnetic field
growth in galaxies!Polarization fraction distributions (top) and their
logarithms (bottom) for sources with and without protogalaxies in the
foreground (pink for DLAs, blue for LLSs, and grey for no intervenor).
Statistical analysis reveals that the distribution for LLSs differs from
the control sample, indicating the presence of magnetized gas. [Adapted
from Farnes et al. 2017]The DLAs appear to consist of mostly non-
turbulent quiescent gas; no dynamo action is currently occurring in
these protogalaxies. The LLSs, on the other hand, appear to be growing
their random magnetic fields via a turbulent dynamo. Thefields have not
yet had enough time to become ordered like the fields of more evolved
galaxies, however.Farnes and collaborators data indicate that magnetic
fields are indeed being gradually built up in early galaxies by dynamos.
They also suggest that DLAs may represent an earlier galactic
evolutionary stage than LLSs, as DLAs havent yet had the time to develop
their magnetic fields to a detectable level.A future increase in sample
size will certainly help improve our understanding of the field
formation process. In the meantime, the data in this study provide the
first observational picture of magnetic field evolution in galaxies,
lending excellent support to theoretical models.CitationJ. S. Farnes et

AB  - Hurricane Bonnie (1998) was an unusually resilient hurricane that
maintained intensity in 12-16 ms-1 vertical wind shear and during an
eyewall replacement cycle from 23-25 August. This remarkable behavior
was examined using observations from flight-level data, microwave
imagery, radar, and dropsondes over the two-day period. The symmetric
and asymmetric aspects of Bonnie's eyewall replacement cycle were
documented and compared to eyewall replacement cycles in other
hurricanes. Similar to other observed eyewall replacement cycles, Bonnie
exhibited the development, strengthening, and dominance of a secondary
eyewall while a primary eyewall decayed. However, Bonnie's structure was
highly asymmetric due to strong 12-16 ms-1 vertical wind shear, in
contrast to the more symmetric structures observed in other hurricanes
undergoing eyewall replacement cycles. It is hypothesized that strong
shear preferentially forced convection downshear, which was able to
extend upshear and form a secondary eyewall through enhanced surface
fluxes upshear. The larger radius of maximum winds after the eyewall
replacement cycle completed might have aided Bonnie's resiliency in
shear by increasing the likelihood that diabatic heating would fall
inside the radius of maximum winds. These observations of Hurricane
Bonnie's ability to maintain intensity in spite of high shear and an
eyewall replacement cycle, both of which usually result in weakening,
provide a new direction from which to view the intensity change issue in
hurricanes.

AB  - Icy grain mantles are the main reservoir for volatile elements in star-
forming regions across the Universe, as well as the formation site of
pre-biotic complex organic molecules (COMs) seen in our Solar System. We
propose to trace the evolution of pristine and complex ice chemistry in
a representative low-mass star-forming region through observations of a:
pre-stellar core, Class 0 protostar, Class I protostar, and
protoplanetary disk. Comparing high spectral resolution (R 1500-3000)
and sensitivity (S/N 100-300) observations from 3 to 15 um to template
spectra, we will map the spatial distribution of ices down to 20-50 AU
in these targets to identify when, and at what visual extinction, the
formation of each ice species begins. Such high-resolution spectra will
allow us to search for new COMs, as well as distinguish between
different ice morphologies,thermal histories, and mixing environments.
The analysis of these data will result in science products beneficial to
Cycle 2 proposers. A newly updated public laboratory ice database will
provide feature identifications for all of the expected ices, while a
chemical model fit to the observed ice abundances will be released
publically as a grid, with varied metallicity and UV fields to simulate
other environments. We will create improved algorithms to extract NIRCAM
WFSS spectra in crowded fields with extended sources as well as optimize
the defringing of MIRI LRS spectra in order to recover broad spectral
features. We anticipate that these resources will be particularly useful
for astrochemistry and spectroscopy of fainter, extended targets like
star forming regions of the SMC/LMC or more distant galaxies.

AB  - M dwarf stars are promising targets in the search for extrasolar
habitable planets, as their small size and close-in habitable zones make
the detection of Earth-analog planets easier than at Solar-type stars.
However, the effects of the high stellar activity of M dwarf hosts has
uncertain effects on such planets, and may render them uninhabitable.
Studying stellar activity at M dwarfs is hindered by a lack of
measurements of high-energy radiation, flare activity and, in
particular, stellar wind rates. We propose to rectify this by observing
a sample of Post Common Envelope Binaries (PCEBs) with HST and XMM-
Newton. PCEBs consist of an M dwarf with a white dwarf companion, which
experiences the same stellar wind and radiation environment as a close-
in planet. The stellar wind of the M dwarf accretes onto the otherwise
pure hydrogen atmosphere white dwarf, producing metal lines detectable
with ultraviolet spectroscopy. The metal lines can be used to measure
accretion rates onto the white dwarf, from with we can accurately infer
the stellar wind mass loss rate of the M dwarf, along with abundances of
key elements. Simultaneous observations with XMM-Newton will probe X-ray
flare occurrence rate and strength, in addition to coronal temperatures.
Performing these measurements over twelve PCEBs will provide a sample of
M dwarf stellar wind strengths, flare occurrence and X-ray/UV activity
that will finally shed light on the true habitability of planets around
small stars.

AB  - In 2016 we saw the first direct detections of gravitational waves by
Advanced LIGO and the positive results from LISA Pathfinder. In this
context, NASA has decided to partner with the ESA on their L3
gravitational wave observatory, whose science goals are outlined in the
white paper, The Gravitational Universe. The current launch date for L3
is 2034, but with the success of Pathfinder and the increased scientific
interest in gravitational waves caused by LIGO, ESA and its member
states are exploring ways to move up the launch date. In the U.S., the
National Academy's Astronomy Midterm Assessment has recommended that
NASA restore support for a gravitational wave mission in this decade
with the goal of realizing the full scientific capability of the mission
envisioned in the 2020 decadal. NASA has appointed the L3 Study Team,
charged with providing analysis of potential U.S. contributions to the
European-led L3 mission and preparing for the next decadal survey. The
LISA mission concept, proposed for L3, will improve our understanding of
the formation and growth of massive black holes, create a census of
compact binary systems in the Milky Way, test general relativity in
extreme conditions, provide predictions of black hole binary mergers in
the LIGO frequency band, and enable searches for new physics.

AB  - Modern data analysis methods such as photometric ubercalibration and
optimized mosaicing with background matching have enhanced the public
products of many large astronomical surveys, but unfortunately not yet
for the GALEX mission. This is significant because GALEX provided our
only view of the entire ultraviolet (UV) sky - a circumstance unlikely
to change for many years. We have recently achieved both these
calibration goals for a subset of the GALEX observations toward the
Magellanic Clouds, substantially increasing the quality and internal
consistency of the source catalogs and fidelity of the diffuse emission
morphology in this limited region. We propose to apply the same methods
to the entire public GALEX database, in order to eliminate remaining
discontinuities in the current photometry and step-like background
artifacts in sky maps. This work will have two principal products: (1)
the updated photometric catalog for all GALEX sources, and (2) a Legacy
all-sky coadd for both the FUV and NUV bands. Traditional GALEX pipeline
analysis only stacked exposures that were obtained as part of the same
planned survey tile. However, a substantial degree of overlap between
independent GALEX observations does exist and can used to produce a
deeper coadd over much of the sky. Redundant coverage also allows
artifacts such as internal reflections to be masked when stacking. Our
ADAP effort will ideally complement the all-sky unWISE reprocessing
project in infrared bands. We will publicly release all products as they
are produced. This project will positively impact both extragalactic and
Milky Way related science and is therefore relevant to a wide range of
NASA priorities.

AB  - Fiber optic networks are no longer just pipelines for transporting data
in the long haul backbone. Exponential growth in traffic in metro-
regional areas has pushed higher capacity fiber toward the edge of the
network, and highly dynamic patterns of heterogeneous traffic have
emerged that are often bursty, severely stressing the historical "fat
and dumb pipe" static optical network, which would need to be massively
over-provisioned to deal with these loads. What is required is a more
intelligent network with a span of control over the optical as well as
electrical transport mechanisms which enables handling of service
requests in a fast and efficient way that guarantees quality of service
(QoS) while optimizing capacity efficiency. An "agile" optical network
is a reconfigurable optical network comprised of high speed intelligent
control system fed by real-time in situ network sensing. It provides
fast response in the control and switching of optical signals in
response to changing traffic demands and network conditions. This agile
control of optical signals is enabled by pushing switching decisions
downward in the network stack to the physical layer. Implementing such
agility is challenging due to the response dynamics and interactions of
signals in the physical layer. Control schemes must deal with issues
such as dynamic power equalization, EDFA transients and cascaded noise
effects, impairments due to self-phase modulation and dispersion, and
channel-to-channel cross talk. If these issues are not properly
predicted and mitigated, attempts at dynamic control can drive the
optical network into an unstable state. In order to enable high speed
actuation of signal modulators and switches, the network controller must
be able to make decisions based on predictive models. In this thesis, we
consider how to take advantage of Software Defined Networking (SDN)
capabilities for network reconfiguration, combined with embedded models
that access updates from deployed network monitoring sensors. In order
to maintain signal quality while optimizing network resources, we find
that it is essential to model and update estimates of the physical link
impairments in real-time. In this thesis, we consider the key elements
required to enable an agile optical network, with contributions as
follows: ∙ Control Framework: extended the SDN concept to include the
optical transport network through extensions to the OpenFlow (OF)
protocol. A unified SDN control plane is built to facilitate control and
management capability across the electrical/packet-switched and optical
/circuit-switched portions of the network seamlessly. The SDN control
plane serves as a platform to abstract the resources of
multilayer/multivendor networks. Through this platform, applications can
dynamically request the network resources to meet their service
requirements. ∙ Use of In-situ Monitors: enabled real-time physical
impairment sensing in the control plane using in-situ Optical
Performance Monitoring (OPM) and bit error rate (BER) analyzers. OPM and
BER values are used as quantitative indicators of the link status and
are fed to the control plane through a high-speed data collection
interface to form a closed-loop feedback system to enable adaptive
resource allocation. ∙ Predictive Network Model: used a network model
embedded in the control layer to study the link status. The estimated
results of network status is fed into the control decisions to
precompute the network resources. The performance of the network model
can be enhanced by the sensing results. ∙ Real-Time Control Algorithms:
investigated various dynamic resource allocation mechanisms supporting
an agile optical network. Intelligent routing and wavelength switching
for recovering from traffic impairments is achieved experimentally in
the agile optical network within one second. A distance-adaptive
spectrum allocation scheme to address transmission impairments caused by
cascaded Wavelength Selective Switches (WSS) is proposed and evaluated
for improving network spectral efficiency.

AB  - Coronal holes are where the fast solar wind streams out of the Suns
atmosphere, sending charged particles on rapid trajectories out into the
solar system. A new study examines how the distribution of coronal holes
has changed over the last 40 years.Coronal holes form where magnetic
field lines open into space (B) instead of looping back to the solar
surface (A). [Sebman81]Source of the Fast Solar WindAs a part of the
Suns natural activity cycle, extremely low-density regions sometimes
form in the solar corona. These coronal holes manifest themselves as
dark patches in X-ray and extreme ultraviolet imaging, since the corona
is much hotter than the solar surface that peeks through from underneath
it.Coronal holes form when magnetic field lines open into space instead
of looping back to the solar surface. In these regions, the solar
atmosphere escapes via these field lines, rapidly streaming away from
the Suns surface in whats known as the fast solar wind.Coronal Holes
Over Space and TimeAutomated detection of coronal holes from image-based
analysis is notoriously difficult. Recently, a team of scientists led by
Kenichi Fujiki (ISEE, Nagoya University, Japan) has developed an
automated prediction technique for coronal holes that relies instead on
magnetic-field data for the Sun, obtained at the National Solar
Observatorys Kitt Peak between 1975 and 2014. The team used these data
to produce a database of 3335 coronal hole predictions over nearly 40
years.Latitude distribution of 2870 coronal holes (each marked by an x;
color indicates polarity), overlaid on the magnetic butterfly map of the
Sun. The low-latitude coronal holes display a similar butterfly pattern,
in which they move closer to the equator over the course of the solar
cycle. Polar coronal holes are more frequent during solar minima.
[Fujiki et al. 2016]Examining trends in the coronal holes distribution
in latitude and time, Fujiki and collaborators find a strong correlation
between the total area covered by low-latitude coronal holes (holes
closer to the Suns equator) and sunspot activity. In contrast, the total
area of high-latitude coronal holes (those near the Suns poles) peaks
around the minimum in each solar cycle and shrinks around each solar
maximum.Predicting the Impact of the Solar WindWhy do these observations
matter? Coronal holes are the source of the fast solar wind, so if we
can better predict the frequency and locations of coronal holes in the
future, we can make better predictions about how the solar wind might
impact us here on Earth.Periodicity of high-latitude (orange) and low-
latitude (blue) coronal-hole areas, and periodicity of galactic cosmic
rays detected at Earth (black). The cosmic rays track the polar coronal-
hole area behavior with a 1-year time lag. [Fujiki et al. 2016]In one
example of this, Fujiki and collaborators show that theres a distinct
correlation between polar coronal-hole area and observed galactic cosmic
rays. Cosmic rays from within our galaxy have long been known to exhibit
a 22-year periodicity. Fujiki and collaborators show that the
periodicity of the galactic cosmic-ray activity tracks that of the polar
coronal-hole area, with a ~1-year lag time which is equivalent to the
propagation time of the solar wind to the termination shock.Polar
coronal holes are therefore a useful observable indicator of the dipole
component of the solar magnetic field, which modulates the incoming
cosmic rays entering our solar system. This coronal hole database will
be a useful tool for understanding the source of solar wind and the many
ways the wind influences the Earth and our solar system.CitationK.

AB  - A systematic inspection of the far-infrared (FIR) properties of evolved
stars allows not only to constrain physical models, but also to
understand the chemical evolution that takes place in the end of their
lives. In this work we intend to study the circumstellar envelopes (CSE)
on a sample of stars in the THROES catalogue from AGB/post-AGB stars to
planetary nebulae using photometry and spectroscopy provided by the PACS
instrument on-board Herschel telescope. In the first part we are
interested in obtaining an estimate of the size of FIR emitting region
and to sort our targets in two classes: point-like and extended.
Secondly, we focus on the molecular component of the envelope traced by
carbon monoxide (CO) rotational lines. We conduct a line survey on a
sample of evolved stars by identifying and measuring flux of both 12CO
and 13CO isotopologues in the PACS range, while looking at the overall
properties of the sample. Lastly, we will be interested in obtaining
physical parameters of the CSE, namely gas temperature, mass and mass-
loss rate on a sample of carbon stars. For that, we make use of PACS
large wavelength coverage, which enables the simultaneous study of a
large number of CO transitions, to perform the rotational diagram
analysis. We report the detection of CO emission in a high number of
stars from the catalogue, which were mostly classified as point-like
targets with a few exceptions of planetary nebulae. High J rotational
number transitions were detected in a number of targets, revealing the
presence of a significant amount of hot gas (T ̃ 400-900 K) and high
mass-loss rates. We conclude that Herschel/PACS is in a privileged
position to detect a new population of warmer gas, typically missed in
sub-mm/mm observations.

AB  - A multiwavelength (radio and optical) observing campaign on SS Cyg is
underway, and AAVSO participation is urgently requested. An AAVSO Alert
Notice will be issued February 5 with full details. The purpose of this
Special Notice is to alert observers right now to the need to monitor SS
Cyg very closely and report your observations to the AAVSO via WebObs at
once. It is likely to go into outburst very soon, and immediate
reporting of outburst behavior is crucial to the success of the
campaign. Previous similar campaigns with Dr. James Miller-Jones and his
colleagues have been very successful. AAVSO observations are used to
trigger multi-site radio observations of SS Cyg in research on radio
emission from this dwarf nova, as well as for correlation with the radio
data during analysis. Visual and CCD/DSLR (particularly V) observations
are requested (no time series unless outburst is underway and radio
observations have been triggered). Its normal minimum magnitude is 11.8
V, but it can fluctuate to around 11.5. If it becomes brighter than 11.5
V, it could well be going into outburst. If it reaches 11.0, it is
almost certainly on its way up. Please report your observations of SS
Cyg to the AAVSO as soon after you make them as possible. If you see it
11.5 or brighter, please report them immediately. Finder charts with
sequence may be created using the AAVSO Variable Star Plotter
(https://www.aavso.org/vsp). Observations should be submitted to the
AAVSO International Database. See full Special Notice for more details.

AB  - Two research endeavors are described in this dissertation; both
undertake problems in solid-state astrophysics, which is a branch of
solid-state physics concerning the extreme conditions found within white
dwarfs and the solid crusts of neutron stars. As much of our knowledge
about these compact objects comes from observation of astrophysical
phenomena, Chapter 1 is devoted to the phenomena, and how they can be
exploited as material property probes. Several of the most interesting
phenomena involve the enormous magnetic fields (B ≥ 1012 gauss) harbored
by many neutron stars, and the interaction between these fields and the
charged particles within the solid crust. Accordingly, Chapter 2 reviews
some theory of strongly-magnetized electrons, which both sets the stage
for Chapter 3, and (hopefully) serves as a useful reference for future
research. Let it now be made clear that this dissertation focuses
exclusively on the "outer crusts," of neutron stars, where no free
neutrons are present (rho < 4x1011 g/cc), and the similarly-composed
interiors of white dwarfs, which have central densities ̃ 107 g/cc. For
the most part we specialize to even lower densities. In Chapter 3,
static and dynamic properties of low density (rho ≥ 106 g/cc) outer
envelopes of neutron stars are calculated within the nonlinear magnetic
Thomas-Fermi model, assuming degenerate electrons. A novel domain
decomposition enables proper description of lattice symmetry and may be
seen as a prototype for the general class of problems involving
nonlinear charge screening of periodic, quasi-low-dimensionality
structures, e.g. liquid crystals. We describe a scalable implementation
of the method using Hypre. Over the density range considered, the
effective shear modulus appears to be a factor of ≈ 20 larger than in
the linearlyscreened Coulomb crystal model, which could have
implications for observables related to astroseismology as well as low
temperature phonon-mediated thermal conductivity. Other findings include
incipient c' < 0 elastic instabilities for both bcc and fcc lattices,
reminiscent of the situation in some light actinides, and suggestive of
a symmetry-lowering transition to a tetragonal or orthorhombic lattice.
Chapter 4 describes a systematic search for multicomponent crystal
structures, carried out for five different ternary systems of nuclei in
a polarizable background of electrons, representative of accreted
neutron star crusts and some white dwarfs. Candidate structures are
"bred" by a genetic algorithm, and optimized at constant pressure under
the assumption of linear response (Thomas-Fermi) charge screening.
Subsequent phase equilibria calculations reveal eight distinct crystal
structures in the T = 0 bulk phase diagrams, five of which are
complicated multinary structures not before predicted in the context of
compact object astrophysics. Frequent instances of geometrically similar
but compositionally distinct phases give insight into structural
preferences of systems with pairwise Yukawa interactions, including and
extending to the regime of low density colloidal suspensions made in a
laboratory. As an application of these main results, we self-
consistently couple the phase stability problem to the equations for a
self-gravitating, hydrostatically stable white dwarf, with fixed overall
composition. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to incorporate
complex multinary phases into the equilibrium phase layering diagram and
mass-radius-composition dependence, both of which are reported for
He-C-O and C-O-Ne white dwarfs. Finite thickness interfacial phases
("interphases") show up at the boundaries between single-component bcc
crystalline regions, some of which have lower lattice symmetry than
cubic. A second application---quasi-static settling of heavy nuclei in
white dwarfs---builds on our equilibrium phase layering method. Tests of
this nonequilibrium method reveal extra phases which play the role of
transient host phases for the settling species.

AB  - Did you know that the very first exoplanets ever confirmed were found
around a pulsar? The precise timing measurements of pulsar PSR 1257+12
were what made the discovery of its planetary companions possible. Yet
surprisingly, though weve discovered thousands of exoplanets since then,
only one other planet has ever been confirmed around a pulsar. Now, a
team of CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science researchers are trying to
figure out why.Formation ChallengesThe lack of detected pulsar planets
may simply reflect the fact that getting a pulsar-planet system is
challenging! There are three main pathways:The planet formed before the
host star became a pulsar which means it somehow survived its star going
supernova (yikes!).The planet formed elsewhere and was captured by the
pulsar.The planet formed out of the debris of the supernova
explosion.The first two options, if even possible, are likely to be rare
occurrences but the third option shows some promise. In this scenario,
after the supernova explosion, a small fraction of the material falls
back toward the stellar remnant and is recaptured, forming what is known
as a supernova fallback disk. According to this model, planets could
potentially form out of this disk.Disk ImplicationsLed by Matthew Kerr,
the CSIRO astronomers set out to systematically look for these potential
planets that might have formed in situ around pulsars. They searched a
sample of 151 young, energetic pulsars, scouring seven years of pulse
time-of-arrival data for periodic variation that could signal the
presence of planetary companions. Their methods to mitigate pulsar
timing noise and model realistic orbits allowed them to have good
sensitivity to low-mass planets.The results? They found no conclusive
evidence that any of these pulsars have planets.This outcome carries
with it some significant implications. The pulsar sample spans 2 Myr in
age, in which planets should have had enough time to form in debris
disks. The fact that none were detected suggests that long-lived
supernova fallback disks may actually be much rarer than thought, or
they exist only in conditions that arent compatible with planet
formation.So if thats the case, what about the planets found around PSR
1257+12? This pulsar may actually be somewhat unique, in that it was
born with an unusually weak magnetic field. This birth defect might have
allowed it to form a fallback disk and, subsequently, planets where the
sample of energetic pulsars studied here could not.CitationM. Kerr et

AB  - The ability to detect small and localized movements of geotechnical
facilities is important for performance monitoring and early-warning
hazard detection. Current deformation monitoring technology is limited
in its ability to both scan massive structures and detect small and
localized movements. Ground-based interferometric radar (GBIR) is an
emerging remote sensing technology that has the potential to fill this
gap in surface deformation monitoring technology. Much of the focus of
previous research and application of GBIR has been on monitoring large
spatial scale movements, such as mine walls, dams, and earth slopes
experiencing deformational movements occurring over hundreds or
thousands of square meters. In this study the focus is on evaluating the
capabilities of GBIR for detecting and monitoring small movements (mm-
scale) occurring over very localized regions (a few m2). Specifically,
this study focused on the application of GBIR for detecting and
monitoring movements of individual boulders in a massive landscape. The
potential long-term application is to use GBIR to detect and monitor
precursor movements to rockfall events. Boulders, ranging from 0.5 to 5
meters in approximate facial dimensions, were moved using pry bars and
airbag jacks in increments of a few to several mm. Two identical GBIR
devices positioned at separate locations scanned a region covering
approximately 20,000 m2 after each boulder movement. Ground truth
measurements were also performed after each boulder movement. The
detectability of the boulder movements was assessed by comparing the
distribution of measured phase values from the boulder to (1) phase
values measured on the surrounding non-moving portion of the image and
(2) phase values measured from the same boulder when it was not moving.
The results from the study showed that movements of boulders with
dimensions larger than about 2 m were detectable for range offset
distances from about 75 to 150 m. Movements as small of 1.7 mm were
detected on these larger boulders. Phase values associated with
movements of the smaller boulders, with dimensions less than about 2 m,
were more difficult to differentiate from the non-moving portions of the
image. This study successfully demonstrated the potential of GBIR to
fill existing gaps in current displacement and deformation monitoring
technology for geotechnical applications.

AB  - Recent works show that the restframe colours of X-ray selected AGN host
galaxies at z~1 are no different from those of inactive galaxies once
stellar mass selection effects are taken into account. However, there is
a clear deficit of AGN among quiescent galaxies, and the average star
formation rates of AGN hosts are comparable or higher than those of
inactive star-forming galaxies. These apparently contradictory findings
could be a consequence of higher extinction in star-forming AGN hosts
compensating for their younger stellar populations in observed colours.
In this talk I will present a new method of extinction correction that
breaks the degeneracy with stellar age and metallicity by comparing the
restframe U-V colour with measurements of the Dn(4000) index on
intermediate band photospectra from SHARDS. I'll show that the
distribution of extinction corrected U-V colours and Dn(4000) for AGN
hosts at z<1 is significantly different from that of comparison samples
of inactive galaxies, with a clear deficit of AGN in intrinsic red
galaxies and a higher prevalence among those with intermediate age
stellar populations.

allows a highly resolved treatment of interactions in clusters of
galaxies, such as high-velocity encounters between elliptical galaxies
and the tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies, as sub-grids follow the
trajectories of individual galaxies. SUPERBOX is efficient in that the
computational overhead is kept as slim as possible and is also memory
efficient since it uses only one set of grids to treat galaxies in
succession.

AB  - The Low Frequency All Sky Monitor (LoFASM) is a distributed array of
dipole antennas that are sensitive to radio frequencies from 10 to 88
MHz. The primary science goals of LoFASM are the detection and study of
low-frequency radio transients, a high priority science goal as deemed
by the National Research Council's decadal survey. LoFASM consists of
antennas and front-end electronics that were originally developed for
the Long Wavelength Array (LWA) by the U.S. Naval Research Lab, the
University of New Mexico, Virginia Tech, and the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory. LoFASM, funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, will
initially consist of four stations, each consisting of 12 dual-
polarization dipole antennas. In a single station, RF signals from each
of the individual LoFASM dipoles are combined in phase in order to
synthesize LoFASM's beam. The LoFASM RF signals are phased up so that
the resulting beam is sensitive to radio emission that originates from
the zenith and RF signals approaching from the horizon are attenuated.
Digitally, this is achieved using a full Stokes 100MHz correlating
spectrometer constructed using field programmable gate array (FPGA)
technology. In this thesis I will describe the design and usage of the
LoFASM Correlator.

<dc:description>Accurate flux calibration for the STIS echelle modes is heavily
dependent on the proper alignment of the blaze function for each
spectral order. However, due to changes in the instrument alignment over
time and between exposures, the blaze function can shift in wavelength.
This may result in flux calibration inconsistencies of up to 10%. We
present the stisblazefix Python module as a tool for STIS users to
correct their echelle spectra. The stisblazefix module assumes that the
error in the blaze alignment is a linear function of spectral order, and
finds the set of shifts that minimizes the flux inconsistencies in the
overlap between spectral orders. We discuss the uses and limitations of
this tool, and show that its use can provide significant improvements to
the default pipeline flux calibration for many observations.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The fluxes of &lt;SUP&gt;3&lt;/SUP&gt;He, &lt;SUP&gt;4&lt;/SUP&gt;He, C, O, and Fe ions at low
energies (about 0.04 - 2 MeV/nucleon) are studied during quiet periods
in Solar Cycles (SC) 23 and 24 using data from the ULEIS/ACE instrument.
In selecting quiet periods (the definition is given in Section 2.1),
additional data from EPHIN/SOHO and EPAM/ACE were also used. The
analysis of the ion energy spectra and their relative abundances shows
that their behavior is governed by their first-ionization potential.
Substantial differences in the ion energy spectra in two consecutive
solar cycles are observed during the quiet periods selected. Quiet-time
fluxes are divided into three distinct types according to the {̃} 80 -
320 keV/nucleon Fe/O ratio. Our results confirm the earlier observation
that these types of suprathermal particles have different origins, that
is, they represent different seed populations that are accelerated by
different processes. Except for the solar activity minimum, the Fe/O
ratio during quiet-time periods correspond either to the abundances of
ions in particle fluxes accelerated in impulsive solar flares or to the
mean abundances of elements in the solar corona. At the activity
minimum, this ratio takes on values that are characteristic for the
solar wind. These results indicate that the background fluxes of low-
energy particles in the ascending, maximum, and decay phases of the
solar cycle include significant contributions from both coronal
particles accelerated to suprathermal energies and ions accelerated in
small impulsive solar flares rich in Fe, while the contribution of
remnants from earlier SEP events cannot be excluded. The comparison of
suprathermal ion abundances during the first five years of SC 23 and SC
24 suggests that the quiet-time and non-quiet fluxes of Fe and
&lt;SUP&gt;3&lt;/SUP&gt;He were lower in SC 24.</dc:description>

<dc:description>We present a speckle survey of Hipparcos visual doubles and
spectroscopic binary stars identified by the Geneva-Copenhagen
spectroscopic survey with the SOAR 4m telescope + HRCam. These systems
represent our best chance to take advantage of Gaia parallaxes for the
purpose of stellar mass determinations. Many of these systems already
have mass fractions (although generally no spectroscopic orbit - an
astrometric orbit will determine individual masses), metallicity
information, and Hipparcos distances. They will be used to improve our
knowledge of the mass-luminosity relation, particularly for lower-
metallicity stars. Our survey will create the first all-sky, volume-
limited, speckle archive for the two primary samples, complementing a
similar effort that has been recently been completed at the WIYN 3.5-m
telescope in the Northern Hemisphere. This extension to the Southern
Hemisphere will fill out the picture for a wider metallicity range.</dc:description>

the event horizon do not exist in static vacuum configurations with
positive cosmological constant. We also show that without a cosmological
constant asymptotically flat solutions cannot possess a degenerate
horizon component. Several independent proofs are presented. One proof
follows easily from differential geometry in the near-horizon limit,
while others use Bakry-Émery-Ricci bounds for static Einstein manifolds.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Due to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration and its effect on global
climates, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
proposes a Clean Power Plan (CPP) mandating CO2 reductions which will
likely force the early retirement of inefficient, aging power plants.
Consequentially, removing these plants equates to a shortfall of
approximately 66 GW of electricity. These factors add to the looming
resource problems of choosing whether to build large replacement power
plants or consider alternative energy sources as a means to help close
the gap between electricity supply and demand in a given region. One
energy source, shallow water tidal currents, represents opportunities to
convert kinetic energy to mechanical forms and provide electricity to
homes and businesses. Nearly 2,000 National Oceanic Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) tidal current data points from Maine to Texas are
considered. This paper, based on systems engineering thinking, provides
key attributes (e.g. turbine efficiency, array size, transmission
losses) for consideration as decision makers seek to identify where to
site Marine Hydrokinetic (MHK) systems and the number of homes powered
by the practical harvest of electricity from tidal currents at those
locations with given attributes. A systems engineering process model is
proposed for consideration as is a regression based equation to estimate
MHK machine parameters needed for power a given number of homes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This spectacular composite (click here for the full image) reveals the
galaxy cluster 1RXS J0603.3+4214, known as the Toothbrush cluster due to
the shape of its most prominent radio relic. Featured in a recent
publication led by Kamlesh Rajpurohit (Thuringian State Observatory,
Germany), this image contains new Very Large Array (VLA) 1.5-GHz
observations (red) showing the radio emission within the cluster. This
is composited with a Chandra view of the X-ray emitting gas of the
cluster (blue) and an optical image of the background from Subaru data.
The new deep VLA data totaling 26 hours of observations provides a
detailed look at the complex structure within the Toothbrush relic,
revealing enigmatic filaments and twists (see below). This new data will
help us to explore the possible merger history of this cluster, which is
theorized to have caused the unusual shapes we see today. For more

<dc:description>The observed evolution of the broad-band spectral energy distribution
(SED) in NS X-ray Nova Aql X-1 during the rise phase of a bright Fast-
Rise-Exponential-Decay-type outburst in 2013 can be understood in the
framework of thermal emission from non-stationary accretion disc with
radial temperature distribution transforming from a single-temperature
blackbody emitting ring into the multicolour irradiated accretion disc.
SED evolution during the hard to soft X-ray state transition looks
unusual, as it cannot be reproduced by the standard disc irradiation
model with a single irradiation parameter for NUV, Optical and NIR
spectral bands. NIR (NUV) band is correlated with soft (hard) X-ray flux
changes during the state transition interval, respectively. In our
interpretation, at the moment of X-ray state transition UV-emitting
parts of the accretion disc are screened from direct X-ray illumination
from the central source and are heated primarily by hard X-rays (E &gt; 10
keV), scattered in the hot corona or wind possibly formed above the
optically thick outer accretion flow; the outer edge of multicolour
disc, which emits in Optical-NIR, can be heated primarily by direct
X-ray illumination. We point out that future simultaneous
multiwavelength observations of X-ray Nova systems during the fast X-ray
state transition interval are of great importance, as it can serve as
'X-ray tomograph' to study physical conditions in outer regions of
accretion flow. This can provide an effective tool to directly test the
energy-dependent X-ray heating efficiency, vertical structure and
accretion flow geometry in transient low-mass X-ray binaries.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover carries a suite of
meteorological detectors that constitute the Rover Environmental
Monitoring Station (REMS) instrument. REMS investigates the
meteorological conditions at Gale crater by obtaining high-frequency
data of pressure, air and ground temperature, relative humidity, UV flux
at the surface and wind intensity and direction with some limitations in
the wind data. We have run a search of atmospheric pressure drops of
short duration (&lt; 25 s) and we present a statistical study of the
frequency of these events in the REMS pressure data during its first
1417 sols (more than two Martian years). The identified daytime pressure
drops could be caused by the close passages of warm vortices and dust
devils. Previous systematic searches of warm vortices from REMS pressure
data (Kahanpää et al., 2016; Steakley and Murphy, 2016) cover about one
Martian year. We show that sudden pressure drops are twice more abundant
in the second Martian year [sols 671-1339] than in the first one
analyzed in previous works. The higher number of detections could be
linked to a combination of different topography, higher altitudes (120 m
above the landing site) and true inter-annual meteorological
variability. We found 1129 events with a pressure drop larger than 0.5
Pa. Of these, 635 occurred during the local daytime (∼56%) and 494 were
nocturnal. The most intense pressure drop (4.2 Pa) occurred at daytime
on sol 1417 (areocentric solar longitude L&lt;SUB&gt;s&lt;/SUB&gt; = 195°) and was
accompanied by a simultaneous decrease in the UV signal of 7.1%,
pointing to a true dust devil. We also discuss similar but less intense
simultaneous pressure and UV radiation drops that constitute 0.7% of all
daytime events. Most of the intense daytime pressure drops with
variations larger than 1.0 Pa occur when the difference between air and
ground temperature is larger than 15 K. Statistically, the frequency of
daytime pressure drops peaks close to noon (12:00-13:00 Local True Solar
Time or LTST) with more events in spring and summer (L&lt;SUB&gt;s&lt;/SUB&gt; from
180° to 360°). The nocturnal sudden pressure drops concentrate in the
20:00-23:00 LTST time interval and they only occur in spring and summer.
We interpret these nocturnal events as a consequence of local
mechanically forced turbulence. This interpretation is consistent with
published results from simulations with the MRAMS model (Rafkin et al.,
2016) that predict a competition between local orographic circulation
and global Hadley cell circulation at Gale crater at summer night-time
that can enhance forced turbulence at the surface. Bursts of pressure
drops appear on particular sols, especially at night-time. Most of the
vortex bursts occurred when MSL was in the region called Pahrump Hills
characterized by a complex terrain. A comparison of the daytime pressure
drops from REMS data with published results from the Pathfinder and
Phoenix missions shows that the frequency of daytime events at Gale
crater in spring and summer is similar to the one previously found at
other locations. Finally, we present possible correlations between MSL
activity and some daytime pressure drops. If such an instrumental effect
is present in the REMS data its impact in this analysis is small and
would only affect about 7% of our detections.</dc:description>

<dc:description>It has been shown by van den Berg and Steif that the sub-critical Ising
model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ is a finitary factor of a finite-valued i.i.d.
process. We strengthen this by showing that the factor map can be made
to have finite expected coding volume (in fact, stretch-exponential
tails), answering a question of van den Berg and Steif. The result holds
at any temperature above the critical temperature. An analogous result
holds for Markov random fields satisfying a high-noise assumption and
for proper colorings with a large number of colors.</dc:description>

large scale surveys in the continuum and spectral lines targeting
important questions ranging from star formation in the Milky Way to

<dc:description>This work is the first study on the 3D shape of starbursting extremely
metal-poor galaxies (XMPs; a galaxy is said to be an XMP if its ionized
gas-phase metallicity is less than 1/10 the solar value). A few hundred
XMPs have been identified in the local universe primarily through mining
the spectroscopic catalog of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and
follow-up observations have shown that metallicity drops significantly
at the starburst (compared to the quiescent component of the galaxy). As
the timescale for gas mixing is short, the metal-poor gas triggering the
starburst must have been accreted recently. This is strong observational
evidence for the cold flow accretion predicted by cosmological models of
galaxy formation, and, in this respect, XMPs seem to be the best local
analogs of the very first galaxies.The ellipsoidal shape of a class of
galaxies can be inferred from the observed axial ratio (q) distribution
(q = minor axis/major axis) of a large sample of randomly-oriented
galaxies. Fitting ellipses to 200 XMPs using r-band SDSS images, we
observe that the axial ratio distribution falls off at q &lt; ~0.4 and q &gt;
~0.8, and we determine that these falloffs are not due to biases in the
data. The falloff at low axial ratio indicates that the XMPs are thick
for their size, and the falloff at high axial ratio suggests the vast
majority of XMPs are triaxial. We also observe that smaller XMPs are
thicker in proportion to their size, and it is expected that for
decreasing galaxy size the ratio of random to rotational motions
increases, which correlates with increasing relative thickness. The XMPs
are low-redshift dwarf galaxies dominated by dark matter, and our
results are compatible with simulations that have shown dark matter
halos to be triaxial, with triaxial stellar distributions for low-mass
galaxies and with triaxiality increasing over time. We will offer
precise constraints on the 3D shape of XMPs via Bayesian analysis of our
observed axial ratio distribution.This work has been supported by the La
Caixa Foundation and the Estallidos Spanish Ministry of Science and

<dc:description>Studies in the last 10 years of dust formation in core-collapse
supernovae (CCSNe) have found only small amounts, 0.001 solar masses.
This is far less than the amount needed to account for the large masses
of dust seen in some high redshift galaxies. However, the recent
discovery of 1 solar mass of cold dust in the ejecta of SN 1987A has has
caused a complete re-evaluation of dust formation in CCSNe. It has been
suggested that the CCSNe are continuously forming dust so that by the
time they are about 25 years old they will have dust masses similar to
SN 1987A. However, there is a wide time gap between the CCSNe that have
been studied recently and SN 1987A. We plan to use the sensitivity of
Spitzer to detect dust emission from SN 2017eaw at two epochs less than
a year after explosion. Radiative transfer models will be used to
estimate the dust masses. These observations will provide a necessary
baseline for our proposed JWST DD ERS observations. This is part of a
long term study to look for evidence of continuous dust formation in
CCSNe. These observations will help shed light on the mystery of dust in
the early universe. SSC Note: A 2019 epoch was added by the TAC.</dc:description>

<dc:description>We investigate the scaling properties of EUV intensity fluctuations seen
in low-latitude coronal holes (CH) and in regions of Quiet Sun (QS), in
signals obtained with the SDO/AIA instrument in the 193 Å waveband.
Contemporaneous time series in the 171 and 211 Å wavebands are used for
comparison among emissions at different heights in the transition region
and low corona. Potential-field extrapolations of contemporaneous
SDO/HMI line-of-sight magnetic fields provide a context in the physical
environment. Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) shows that the
variance of the fluctuations obeys a power-law as a function of temporal
scales with periods in the range ~15-60 min. This scaling is
characterized by a generalized Hurst exponent α. In QS regions, and in
regions within CHs that include magnetic bipoles, the scaling exponent
lies in the range 1.0 &lt; α &lt; 1.5, and it thus corresponds to anti-
correlated, turbulent-like, dynamical processes. Regions inside the
coronal holes primarily associated with magnetic field of a dominant
single polarity, have a generalized exponent (0.5 &lt; α &lt; 1) corresponding
to positively correlated (“persistent”) processes. The results indicate
the influence of the magnetic fields on the dynamics of the emission.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Flares are thought to be sudden releases of magnetic energy stored
around starspots. Recent space high-precision photometry shows
“superflares”, 10-10&lt;SUP&gt;4&lt;/SUP&gt; times more energetic than the largest
solar flares, occur on many G, K, M-type stars (e.g., Maehara+2012
Nature). Harmful UV/X-ray radiation and high-energy particles such as
protons are caused by such superflares. This may suggest that exoplanet
host stars have severe effects on the physical and chemical evolution of
exoplanetary atmospheres (cf. Segura+2010 Astrobiology, Takahashi+2016
ApJL).We here present statistical properties of superflares on G, K,
M-type stars on the basis of our analyses of Kepler photometric data
(Maehara+2012 Nature, Shibayama+2013 ApJS, Notsu+2013 ApJ,
Canderaresi+2014 ApJ, Maehara+2015 EPS, Maehara+2017 PASJ). We found
more than 5000 superflares on 800 G, K, M-type main-sequence stars, and
the occurrence frequency (dN/dE) of superflares as a function of flare
energy (E) shows the power-law distribution with the index of -1.8 -1.9.
This power-law distribution is consistent with that of solar
flares.Flare frequency increases as stellar temperature decreases. As
for M-type stars, energy of the largest flares is smaller compared with
G,K-type stars, but more frequent “hazardous” flares for the habitable
planets since the habitable zone around M-type stars is much smaller
compared with G, K-type stars.Rotation period and starspot coverage can
be estimated from the quasi-periodic brightness variation of the
superflare stars. The intensity of Ca II 8542 line of superflare stars,
which is measured from spectroscopic observations with Subaru Telescope,
has a well correlation with the brightness variation amplitude
(Notsu+2015a&amp;b PASJ).Flare frequency has a correlation with rotation
period, and this suggests young rapidly-rotating stars (like “young
Sun”) have more severe impacts of flares on the planetary atmosphere
(cf. Airapetian+2016 ApJL). Flare energy and frequency also depends on

<dc:description>Different groups of meteorites have distinctive isotopic compositions.
In a 2011 paper, Paul Warren (University of California, Los Angeles)
showed that there is a clear dichotomy in chromium and titanium isotopic
compositions between carbonaceous chondrites and all the other types of
stony meteorites, plus Earth, Moon, and Mars. Thomas Kruijer (Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, California and University of Münster,
Germany) and colleagues at the University of Münster now show that the
dichotomy involves iron meteorites as well as rocky ones. The two
distinct groups were nicknamed the CC (those with isotopes like
carbonaceous chondrites) and NC (those with isotopes like non-
carbonaceous meteorites). Kruijer and colleagues were able to determine
the time of core formation in the planetesimals in which iron meteorites
formed and report that CC iron meteorites formed 2.2 to 2.8 million
years after CAI formation, whereas the NC iron meteorites formed
earlier, before 1.8 million years after CAIs. (CAIs, calcium-aluminum-
rich inclusions, are the first solids to form in the Solar System and
give us a time-zero reference marker.) The accretion of the
planetesimals preceded core formation. Thermal calculations done by
Kruijer and colleagues indicate that NC objects accreted at 0.4 million
years after CAIs. In contrast, the CC objects accreted at 0.9 million
years after CAIs. Kruijer and colleagues suggest on the basis of their
results and published models for the formation of Jupiter that the
dichotomy resulted from Jupiter's formation. The NC materials accreted
when there was a continuous gas disk characterized by solids flowing
inwards towards the Sun. However, less than a million years later,
something interrupted this continuous flow, leading to formation of the
isotopic dichotomy. Kruijer and coworkers suggest that rapid accretion
of Jupiter's solid, mostly rocky core was the event that disrupted the
continuous inwards flow. Models suggest that Jupiter would have grown to
about 20 Earth masses, after which it grew by accreting gases to it. The
ages of the NC and CC iron meteorite groups indicate that Jupiter's
rocky core formed about 1 million years after CAIs. Sophisticated models
for planetary accretion predict early formation of the rocky core of
Jupiter, but suggest this process took between 1 and 10 million years
(after CAIs). Quantitative meteorite data show that the time was around
a million years, providing useful input for improving the models and
showing the value of combining theory with data on ancient samples.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Fluctuations are one of the main probes of the physics of the new state
of hot and dense nuclear matter called the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP)
which is created in the ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. In this
dissertation we extend and improve upon the existing descriptions of
heavy ion collisions in three different directions: we study the new
signatures of initial state fluctuations, the propagation of
perturbations in the early stages of the collision, and the effect of
thermal fluctuations on the hydrodynamic expansion of the QGP. First, in
Chapter 3 we study initial state fluctuations by examining the complete
statistical information contained in the two-particle correlation
measurements in hydrodynamic simulations of Pb+Pb collisions at the CERN
Large Hadron Collider (√sNN = 2.76 TeV). We use Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) to decompose the spectrum of harmonic flow, v_n(p_T) for
n = 0-5, into dominant components. The leading component is identified
with the standard event plane vn(pT), while the subleading component
describes additional fluctuations in the two-particle correlation
function. We find good geometric predictors for the orientation and the
magnitude of the leading and the subleading flows. The subleading v 0,
v1, and v3 flow harmonics are shown to be a response to the radial
excitation of the corresponding eccentricity epsilonn. In contrast, for
v2 the subleading flow in peripheral collisions is dominated by the
nonlinear mixing between the leading elliptic flow and radial flow
fluctuations. Nonlinear mixing also plays a significant role in
generating subleading v4 and v 5 harmonics. The PCA gives a systematic
way of studying the full information of the two-particle correlation
matrix and identifying the subleading flows, which we show are
responsible for factorization breaking in hydrodynamics. Second, in
Chapter 4 we study the thermalization and hydrodynamization of
fluctuations at the early stages of heavy ion collisions. We use leading
order effective kinetic theory, accurate at weak coupling, to simulate
the pre-equilibrium evolution of transverse energy and flow
perturbations. For the short evolution we can use a linear response
theory to construct the pre-equilibrium Green functions. Then the
energy-momentum tensor at a time when hydrodynamics becomes applicable
can be expressed as a linear convolution of response functions with the
initial perturbations. We propose combining effective kinetic theory
with weak coupling initial state models, such as IP-Glasma, to model the
complete pre-thermal evolution from saturated nuclei to hydrodynamics in
a weak coupling framework. Last, in Chapter 5 we consider out-of-
equilibrium hydrodynamic fluctuations in the expanding QGP. We develop a
set of kinetic equations for a correlator of thermal fluctuations which
are equivalent to nonlinear hydrodynamics with noise. We first show that
the kinetic response precisely reproduces the one-loop renormalization
of the shear viscosity for a static fluid. We then use the hydro-kinetic
equations to analyze thermal fluctuations for a Bjorken expansion. The
steady state solution to the kinetic equations determine the coefficient
of the first fractional power of the gradient expansion (infinity 1/(tau
T)3/2), which was computed here for the first time. The formalism of
hydro-kinetic equations can be applied to more general background flows
and coupled to existing viscous hydrodynamic codes to incorporate the
physics of hydrodynamic fluctuations.</dc:description>

<dc:description>How do magnetic fields form and evolve in early galaxies? A new study
has provided some clever observations to help us answer this
question.The Puzzle of Growing FieldsDynamo theory is the primary model
describing how magnetic fields develop in galaxies. In this picture,
magnetic fields start out as weak seed fields that are small and
unordered. These fields then become ordered and amplified by large-scale
rotation and turbulence in galaxy disks and halos, eventually leading to
the magnetic fields we observe in galaxies today.Schematic showinghow to
indirectly measure protogalactic magnetic fields. The measured
polarization of a background quasar is altered by the fields in a
foreground protogalaxy. Click for a closer look! [Farnes et al.
2017/Adolf Schaller/STSCI/NRAO/AUI/NSF]To test this model, we need
observations of the magnetic fields in young protogalaxies.
Unfortunately, we dont have the sensitivity to be able to measure these
fields directly but a team of scientists led by Jamie Farnes (Radboud
University in the Netherlands) have come up with a creative
alternative.The key is to find early protogalaxies that absorb the light
of more distant background objects. If a protogalaxy lies between us and
a distant quasar, then magnetic fields of the protogalaxy if present
will affect the polarization measurements of the background
quasar.Observing Galactic Building BlocksTop: Redshift distribution for
the background quasars in the authors sample. Bottom: Redshift
distribution for the foreground protogalaxies the authors are exploring.
[Farnes et al. 2017]Farnes and collaborators examined two types of
foreground protogalaxies: Damped Lyman-Alpha Absorbers (DLAs) and Lyman
Limit Systems (LLSs). They obtained polarimetric data for a sample of
114 distant quasars with nothing in the foreground (the control sample),
19 quasars with DLAs in the foreground, and 27 quasars with LLSs in the
foreground. They then used statistical analysis techniques to draw
conclusions about the magnetic fields in the foreground
protogalaxies.Farnes and collaborators were unable to detect either
coherent or random magnetic fields in DLAs. LLSs, however, showed some
evidence of coherent magnetic fields and significant evidence of
incoherent magnetic fields. The observations show that the magnetized
gas in LLSs must be highly turbulent on a scale of 520 parsecs similar
to turbulence scales in the Milky Way.Support for DynamosWhat do these
observations imply? Both support the dynamo theory of magnetic field
growth in galaxies!Polarization fraction distributions (top) and their
logarithms (bottom) for sources with and without protogalaxies in the
foreground (pink for DLAs, blue for LLSs, and grey for no intervenor).
Statistical analysis reveals that the distribution for LLSs differs from
the control sample, indicating the presence of magnetized gas. [Adapted
from Farnes et al. 2017]The DLAs appear to consist of mostly non-
turbulent quiescent gas; no dynamo action is currently occurring in
these protogalaxies. The LLSs, on the other hand, appear to be growing
their random magnetic fields via a turbulent dynamo. Thefields have not
yet had enough time to become ordered like the fields of more evolved
galaxies, however.Farnes and collaborators data indicate that magnetic
fields are indeed being gradually built up in early galaxies by dynamos.
They also suggest that DLAs may represent an earlier galactic
evolutionary stage than LLSs, as DLAs havent yet had the time to develop
their magnetic fields to a detectable level.A future increase in sample
size will certainly help improve our understanding of the field
formation process. In the meantime, the data in this study provide the
first observational picture of magnetic field evolution in galaxies,
lending excellent support to theoretical models.CitationJ. S. Farnes et

<dc:description>Hurricane Bonnie (1998) was an unusually resilient hurricane that
maintained intensity in 12-16 ms-1 vertical wind shear and during an
eyewall replacement cycle from 23-25 August. This remarkable behavior
was examined using observations from flight-level data, microwave
imagery, radar, and dropsondes over the two-day period. The symmetric
and asymmetric aspects of Bonnie's eyewall replacement cycle were
documented and compared to eyewall replacement cycles in other
hurricanes. Similar to other observed eyewall replacement cycles, Bonnie
exhibited the development, strengthening, and dominance of a secondary
eyewall while a primary eyewall decayed. However, Bonnie's structure was
highly asymmetric due to strong 12-16 ms-1 vertical wind shear, in
contrast to the more symmetric structures observed in other hurricanes
undergoing eyewall replacement cycles. It is hypothesized that strong
shear preferentially forced convection downshear, which was able to
extend upshear and form a secondary eyewall through enhanced surface
fluxes upshear. The larger radius of maximum winds after the eyewall
replacement cycle completed might have aided Bonnie's resiliency in
shear by increasing the likelihood that diabatic heating would fall
inside the radius of maximum winds. These observations of Hurricane
Bonnie's ability to maintain intensity in spite of high shear and an
eyewall replacement cycle, both of which usually result in weakening,
provide a new direction from which to view the intensity change issue in
hurricanes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Icy grain mantles are the main reservoir for volatile elements in star-
forming regions across the Universe, as well as the formation site of
pre-biotic complex organic molecules (COMs) seen in our Solar System. We
propose to trace the evolution of pristine and complex ice chemistry in
a representative low-mass star-forming region through observations of a:
pre-stellar core, Class 0 protostar, Class I protostar, and
protoplanetary disk. Comparing high spectral resolution (R 1500-3000)
and sensitivity (S/N 100-300) observations from 3 to 15 um to template
spectra, we will map the spatial distribution of ices down to 20-50 AU
in these targets to identify when, and at what visual extinction, the
formation of each ice species begins. Such high-resolution spectra will
allow us to search for new COMs, as well as distinguish between
different ice morphologies,thermal histories, and mixing environments.
The analysis of these data will result in science products beneficial to
Cycle 2 proposers. A newly updated public laboratory ice database will
provide feature identifications for all of the expected ices, while a
chemical model fit to the observed ice abundances will be released
publically as a grid, with varied metallicity and UV fields to simulate
other environments. We will create improved algorithms to extract NIRCAM
WFSS spectra in crowded fields with extended sources as well as optimize
the defringing of MIRI LRS spectra in order to recover broad spectral
features. We anticipate that these resources will be particularly useful
for astrochemistry and spectroscopy of fainter, extended targets like
star forming regions of the SMC/LMC or more distant galaxies.</dc:description>

<dc:description>M dwarf stars are promising targets in the search for extrasolar
habitable planets, as their small size and close-in habitable zones make
the detection of Earth-analog planets easier than at Solar-type stars.
However, the effects of the high stellar activity of M dwarf hosts has
uncertain effects on such planets, and may render them uninhabitable.
Studying stellar activity at M dwarfs is hindered by a lack of
measurements of high-energy radiation, flare activity and, in
particular, stellar wind rates. We propose to rectify this by observing
a sample of Post Common Envelope Binaries (PCEBs) with HST and XMM-
Newton. PCEBs consist of an M dwarf with a white dwarf companion, which
experiences the same stellar wind and radiation environment as a close-
in planet. The stellar wind of the M dwarf accretes onto the otherwise
pure hydrogen atmosphere white dwarf, producing metal lines detectable
with ultraviolet spectroscopy. The metal lines can be used to measure
accretion rates onto the white dwarf, from with we can accurately infer
the stellar wind mass loss rate of the M dwarf, along with abundances of
key elements. Simultaneous observations with XMM-Newton will probe X-ray
flare occurrence rate and strength, in addition to coronal temperatures.
Performing these measurements over twelve PCEBs will provide a sample of
M dwarf stellar wind strengths, flare occurrence and X-ray/UV activity
that will finally shed light on the true habitability of planets around
small stars.</dc:description>

paper "Astronomy in Korea" (Rufus, Transactions of the Korea Branch of
the Royal Asiatic Society, XXVI, 1-69, 1936), and the books The Hall of
Heavenly Records, Korean Astronomical Instruments and Clocks 1380-1780
(Needham et al., Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1986a) and
History of Astronomy in Korea (Nha, Seoul National University Press,
Seoul, 2000). In order to overview the emergence and development of
modern astronomy and astrophysics in South Korea, much of the present
chapter is based on these three references, along with various papers
published by the present authors and other astronomers.</dc:description>

<dc:description>DMATIS (Dark Matter ATtenuation Importance Sampling) calculates the
trajectories of DM particles that propagate in the Earth's crust and the
lead shield to reach the DAMIC detector using an importance sampling
Monte-Carlo simulation. A detailed Monte-Carlo simulation avoids the
deficiencies of the SGED/KS method that uses a mean energy loss
description to calculate the lower bound on the DM-proton cross section.
The code implementing the importance sampling technique makes the brute-
force Monte-Carlo simulation of moderately strongly interacting DM with
nucleons computationally feasible. DMATIS is written in Python 3 and
MATHEMATICA.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In 2016 we saw the first direct detections of gravitational waves by
Advanced LIGO and the positive results from LISA Pathfinder. In this
context, NASA has decided to partner with the ESA on their L3
gravitational wave observatory, whose science goals are outlined in the
white paper, The Gravitational Universe. The current launch date for L3
is 2034, but with the success of Pathfinder and the increased scientific
interest in gravitational waves caused by LIGO, ESA and its member
states are exploring ways to move up the launch date. In the U.S., the
National Academy's Astronomy Midterm Assessment has recommended that
NASA restore support for a gravitational wave mission in this decade
with the goal of realizing the full scientific capability of the mission
envisioned in the 2020 decadal. NASA has appointed the L3 Study Team,
charged with providing analysis of potential U.S. contributions to the
European-led L3 mission and preparing for the next decadal survey. The
LISA mission concept, proposed for L3, will improve our understanding of
the formation and growth of massive black holes, create a census of
compact binary systems in the Milky Way, test general relativity in
extreme conditions, provide predictions of black hole binary mergers in
the LIGO frequency band, and enable searches for new physics.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Modern data analysis methods such as photometric ubercalibration and
optimized mosaicing with background matching have enhanced the public
products of many large astronomical surveys, but unfortunately not yet
for the GALEX mission. This is significant because GALEX provided our
only view of the entire ultraviolet (UV) sky - a circumstance unlikely
to change for many years. We have recently achieved both these
calibration goals for a subset of the GALEX observations toward the
Magellanic Clouds, substantially increasing the quality and internal
consistency of the source catalogs and fidelity of the diffuse emission
morphology in this limited region. We propose to apply the same methods
to the entire public GALEX database, in order to eliminate remaining
discontinuities in the current photometry and step-like background
artifacts in sky maps. This work will have two principal products: (1)
the updated photometric catalog for all GALEX sources, and (2) a Legacy
all-sky coadd for both the FUV and NUV bands. Traditional GALEX pipeline
analysis only stacked exposures that were obtained as part of the same
planned survey tile. However, a substantial degree of overlap between
independent GALEX observations does exist and can used to produce a
deeper coadd over much of the sky. Redundant coverage also allows
artifacts such as internal reflections to be masked when stacking. Our
ADAP effort will ideally complement the all-sky unWISE reprocessing
project in infrared bands. We will publicly release all products as they
are produced. This project will positively impact both extragalactic and
Milky Way related science and is therefore relevant to a wide range of
NASA priorities.</dc:description>

multi-band photometric data set for the entire southern sky. EDR covers
approximately 6700 sq. deg. (one-third) of the southern sky as obtained
by the Short Survey component of the project. All included fields have
at least two visits in good conditions in all six SkyMapper filters
(uvgriz). Object catalogues are complete to magnitude 17-18, depending
on filter. IVOA-complaint table access protocol (TAP), cone search and
simple image access protocol (SIAP) services are available from the
SkyMapper website (http://skymapper.anu.edu.au/), as well as through
tools such as TOPCAT. Data are restricted to Australian astronomers and
their collaborators for twelve months from the release date. Further

<dc:description>Fiber optic networks are no longer just pipelines for transporting data
in the long haul backbone. Exponential growth in traffic in metro-
regional areas has pushed higher capacity fiber toward the edge of the
network, and highly dynamic patterns of heterogeneous traffic have
emerged that are often bursty, severely stressing the historical "fat
and dumb pipe" static optical network, which would need to be massively
over-provisioned to deal with these loads. What is required is a more
intelligent network with a span of control over the optical as well as
electrical transport mechanisms which enables handling of service
requests in a fast and efficient way that guarantees quality of service
(QoS) while optimizing capacity efficiency. An "agile" optical network
is a reconfigurable optical network comprised of high speed intelligent
control system fed by real-time in situ network sensing. It provides
fast response in the control and switching of optical signals in
response to changing traffic demands and network conditions. This agile
control of optical signals is enabled by pushing switching decisions
downward in the network stack to the physical layer. Implementing such
agility is challenging due to the response dynamics and interactions of
signals in the physical layer. Control schemes must deal with issues
such as dynamic power equalization, EDFA transients and cascaded noise
effects, impairments due to self-phase modulation and dispersion, and
channel-to-channel cross talk. If these issues are not properly
predicted and mitigated, attempts at dynamic control can drive the
optical network into an unstable state. In order to enable high speed
actuation of signal modulators and switches, the network controller must
be able to make decisions based on predictive models. In this thesis, we
consider how to take advantage of Software Defined Networking (SDN)
capabilities for network reconfiguration, combined with embedded models
that access updates from deployed network monitoring sensors. In order
to maintain signal quality while optimizing network resources, we find
that it is essential to model and update estimates of the physical link
impairments in real-time. In this thesis, we consider the key elements
required to enable an agile optical network, with contributions as
follows: ∙ Control Framework: extended the SDN concept to include the
optical transport network through extensions to the OpenFlow (OF)
protocol. A unified SDN control plane is built to facilitate control and
management capability across the electrical/packet-switched and optical
/circuit-switched portions of the network seamlessly. The SDN control
plane serves as a platform to abstract the resources of
multilayer/multivendor networks. Through this platform, applications can
dynamically request the network resources to meet their service
requirements. ∙ Use of In-situ Monitors: enabled real-time physical
impairment sensing in the control plane using in-situ Optical
Performance Monitoring (OPM) and bit error rate (BER) analyzers. OPM and
BER values are used as quantitative indicators of the link status and
are fed to the control plane through a high-speed data collection
interface to form a closed-loop feedback system to enable adaptive
resource allocation. ∙ Predictive Network Model: used a network model
embedded in the control layer to study the link status. The estimated
results of network status is fed into the control decisions to
precompute the network resources. The performance of the network model
can be enhanced by the sensing results. ∙ Real-Time Control Algorithms:
investigated various dynamic resource allocation mechanisms supporting
an agile optical network. Intelligent routing and wavelength switching
for recovering from traffic impairments is achieved experimentally in
the agile optical network within one second. A distance-adaptive
spectrum allocation scheme to address transmission impairments caused by
cascaded Wavelength Selective Switches (WSS) is proposed and evaluated
for improving network spectral efficiency.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Coronal holes are where the fast solar wind streams out of the Suns
atmosphere, sending charged particles on rapid trajectories out into the
solar system. A new study examines how the distribution of coronal holes
has changed over the last 40 years.Coronal holes form where magnetic
field lines open into space (B) instead of looping back to the solar
surface (A). [Sebman81]Source of the Fast Solar WindAs a part of the
Suns natural activity cycle, extremely low-density regions sometimes
form in the solar corona. These coronal holes manifest themselves as
dark patches in X-ray and extreme ultraviolet imaging, since the corona
is much hotter than the solar surface that peeks through from underneath
it.Coronal holes form when magnetic field lines open into space instead
of looping back to the solar surface. In these regions, the solar
atmosphere escapes via these field lines, rapidly streaming away from
the Suns surface in whats known as the fast solar wind.Coronal Holes
Over Space and TimeAutomated detection of coronal holes from image-based
analysis is notoriously difficult. Recently, a team of scientists led by
Kenichi Fujiki (ISEE, Nagoya University, Japan) has developed an
automated prediction technique for coronal holes that relies instead on
magnetic-field data for the Sun, obtained at the National Solar
Observatorys Kitt Peak between 1975 and 2014. The team used these data
to produce a database of 3335 coronal hole predictions over nearly 40
years.Latitude distribution of 2870 coronal holes (each marked by an x;
color indicates polarity), overlaid on the magnetic butterfly map of the
Sun. The low-latitude coronal holes display a similar butterfly pattern,
in which they move closer to the equator over the course of the solar
cycle. Polar coronal holes are more frequent during solar minima.
[Fujiki et al. 2016]Examining trends in the coronal holes distribution
in latitude and time, Fujiki and collaborators find a strong correlation
between the total area covered by low-latitude coronal holes (holes
closer to the Suns equator) and sunspot activity. In contrast, the total
area of high-latitude coronal holes (those near the Suns poles) peaks
around the minimum in each solar cycle and shrinks around each solar
maximum.Predicting the Impact of the Solar WindWhy do these observations
matter? Coronal holes are the source of the fast solar wind, so if we
can better predict the frequency and locations of coronal holes in the
future, we can make better predictions about how the solar wind might
impact us here on Earth.Periodicity of high-latitude (orange) and low-
latitude (blue) coronal-hole areas, and periodicity of galactic cosmic
rays detected at Earth (black). The cosmic rays track the polar coronal-
hole area behavior with a 1-year time lag. [Fujiki et al. 2016]In one
example of this, Fujiki and collaborators show that theres a distinct
correlation between polar coronal-hole area and observed galactic cosmic
rays. Cosmic rays from within our galaxy have long been known to exhibit
a 22-year periodicity. Fujiki and collaborators show that the
periodicity of the galactic cosmic-ray activity tracks that of the polar
coronal-hole area, with a ~1-year lag time which is equivalent to the
propagation time of the solar wind to the termination shock.Polar
coronal holes are therefore a useful observable indicator of the dipole
component of the solar magnetic field, which modulates the incoming
cosmic rays entering our solar system. This coronal hole database will
be a useful tool for understanding the source of solar wind and the many
ways the wind influences the Earth and our solar system.CitationK.

<dc:description>A systematic inspection of the far-infrared (FIR) properties of evolved
stars allows not only to constrain physical models, but also to
understand the chemical evolution that takes place in the end of their
lives. In this work we intend to study the circumstellar envelopes (CSE)
on a sample of stars in the THROES catalogue from AGB/post-AGB stars to
planetary nebulae using photometry and spectroscopy provided by the PACS
instrument on-board Herschel telescope. In the first part we are
interested in obtaining an estimate of the size of FIR emitting region
and to sort our targets in two classes: point-like and extended.
Secondly, we focus on the molecular component of the envelope traced by
carbon monoxide (CO) rotational lines. We conduct a line survey on a
sample of evolved stars by identifying and measuring flux of both 12CO
and 13CO isotopologues in the PACS range, while looking at the overall
properties of the sample. Lastly, we will be interested in obtaining
physical parameters of the CSE, namely gas temperature, mass and mass-
loss rate on a sample of carbon stars. For that, we make use of PACS
large wavelength coverage, which enables the simultaneous study of a
large number of CO transitions, to perform the rotational diagram
analysis. We report the detection of CO emission in a high number of
stars from the catalogue, which were mostly classified as point-like
targets with a few exceptions of planetary nebulae. High J rotational
number transitions were detected in a number of targets, revealing the
presence of a significant amount of hot gas (T ̃ 400-900 K) and high
mass-loss rates. We conclude that Herschel/PACS is in a privileged
position to detect a new population of warmer gas, typically missed in
sub-mm/mm observations.</dc:description>

homogenization kernel between two PSFs; the code is well-suited for PSF
matching applications in both an astronomical or microscopy context. It
can warp (rotation + resampling) the PSF images (if necessary), filter
images in Fourier space using a regularized Wiener filter, and produce a
homogenization kernel. PyPHER requires the pixel scale information to be

<dc:description>A multiwavelength (radio and optical) observing campaign on SS Cyg is
underway, and AAVSO participation is urgently requested. An AAVSO Alert
Notice will be issued February 5 with full details. The purpose of this
Special Notice is to alert observers right now to the need to monitor SS
Cyg very closely and report your observations to the AAVSO via WebObs at
once. It is likely to go into outburst very soon, and immediate
reporting of outburst behavior is crucial to the success of the
campaign. Previous similar campaigns with Dr. James Miller-Jones and his
colleagues have been very successful. AAVSO observations are used to
trigger multi-site radio observations of SS Cyg in research on radio
emission from this dwarf nova, as well as for correlation with the radio
data during analysis. Visual and CCD/DSLR (particularly V) observations
are requested (no time series unless outburst is underway and radio
observations have been triggered). Its normal minimum magnitude is 11.8
V, but it can fluctuate to around 11.5. If it becomes brighter than 11.5
V, it could well be going into outburst. If it reaches 11.0, it is
almost certainly on its way up. Please report your observations of SS
Cyg to the AAVSO as soon after you make them as possible. If you see it
11.5 or brighter, please report them immediately. Finder charts with
sequence may be created using the AAVSO Variable Star Plotter
(https://www.aavso.org/vsp). Observations should be submitted to the
AAVSO International Database. See full Special Notice for more details.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Two research endeavors are described in this dissertation; both
undertake problems in solid-state astrophysics, which is a branch of
solid-state physics concerning the extreme conditions found within white
dwarfs and the solid crusts of neutron stars. As much of our knowledge
about these compact objects comes from observation of astrophysical
phenomena, Chapter 1 is devoted to the phenomena, and how they can be
exploited as material property probes. Several of the most interesting
phenomena involve the enormous magnetic fields (B ≥ 1012 gauss) harbored
by many neutron stars, and the interaction between these fields and the
charged particles within the solid crust. Accordingly, Chapter 2 reviews
some theory of strongly-magnetized electrons, which both sets the stage
for Chapter 3, and (hopefully) serves as a useful reference for future
research. Let it now be made clear that this dissertation focuses
exclusively on the "outer crusts," of neutron stars, where no free
neutrons are present (rho &lt; 4x1011 g/cc), and the similarly-composed
interiors of white dwarfs, which have central densities ̃ 107 g/cc. For
the most part we specialize to even lower densities. In Chapter 3,
static and dynamic properties of low density (rho ≥ 106 g/cc) outer
envelopes of neutron stars are calculated within the nonlinear magnetic
Thomas-Fermi model, assuming degenerate electrons. A novel domain
decomposition enables proper description of lattice symmetry and may be
seen as a prototype for the general class of problems involving
nonlinear charge screening of periodic, quasi-low-dimensionality
structures, e.g. liquid crystals. We describe a scalable implementation
of the method using Hypre. Over the density range considered, the
effective shear modulus appears to be a factor of ≈ 20 larger than in
the linearlyscreened Coulomb crystal model, which could have
implications for observables related to astroseismology as well as low
temperature phonon-mediated thermal conductivity. Other findings include
incipient c' &lt; 0 elastic instabilities for both bcc and fcc lattices,
reminiscent of the situation in some light actinides, and suggestive of
a symmetry-lowering transition to a tetragonal or orthorhombic lattice.
Chapter 4 describes a systematic search for multicomponent crystal
structures, carried out for five different ternary systems of nuclei in
a polarizable background of electrons, representative of accreted
neutron star crusts and some white dwarfs. Candidate structures are
"bred" by a genetic algorithm, and optimized at constant pressure under
the assumption of linear response (Thomas-Fermi) charge screening.
Subsequent phase equilibria calculations reveal eight distinct crystal
structures in the T = 0 bulk phase diagrams, five of which are
complicated multinary structures not before predicted in the context of
compact object astrophysics. Frequent instances of geometrically similar
but compositionally distinct phases give insight into structural
preferences of systems with pairwise Yukawa interactions, including and
extending to the regime of low density colloidal suspensions made in a
laboratory. As an application of these main results, we self-
consistently couple the phase stability problem to the equations for a
self-gravitating, hydrostatically stable white dwarf, with fixed overall
composition. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to incorporate
complex multinary phases into the equilibrium phase layering diagram and
mass-radius-composition dependence, both of which are reported for
He-C-O and C-O-Ne white dwarfs. Finite thickness interfacial phases
("interphases") show up at the boundaries between single-component bcc
crystalline regions, some of which have lower lattice symmetry than
cubic. A second application---quasi-static settling of heavy nuclei in
white dwarfs---builds on our equilibrium phase layering method. Tests of
this nonequilibrium method reveal extra phases which play the role of
transient host phases for the settling species.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Did you know that the very first exoplanets ever confirmed were found
around a pulsar? The precise timing measurements of pulsar PSR 1257+12
were what made the discovery of its planetary companions possible. Yet
surprisingly, though weve discovered thousands of exoplanets since then,
only one other planet has ever been confirmed around a pulsar. Now, a
team of CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science researchers are trying to
figure out why.Formation ChallengesThe lack of detected pulsar planets
may simply reflect the fact that getting a pulsar-planet system is
challenging! There are three main pathways:The planet formed before the
host star became a pulsar which means it somehow survived its star going
supernova (yikes!).The planet formed elsewhere and was captured by the
pulsar.The planet formed out of the debris of the supernova
explosion.The first two options, if even possible, are likely to be rare
occurrences but the third option shows some promise. In this scenario,
after the supernova explosion, a small fraction of the material falls
back toward the stellar remnant and is recaptured, forming what is known
as a supernova fallback disk. According to this model, planets could
potentially form out of this disk.Disk ImplicationsLed by Matthew Kerr,
the CSIRO astronomers set out to systematically look for these potential
planets that might have formed in situ around pulsars. They searched a
sample of 151 young, energetic pulsars, scouring seven years of pulse
time-of-arrival data for periodic variation that could signal the
presence of planetary companions. Their methods to mitigate pulsar
timing noise and model realistic orbits allowed them to have good
sensitivity to low-mass planets.The results? They found no conclusive
evidence that any of these pulsars have planets.This outcome carries
with it some significant implications. The pulsar sample spans 2 Myr in
age, in which planets should have had enough time to form in debris
disks. The fact that none were detected suggests that long-lived
supernova fallback disks may actually be much rarer than thought, or
they exist only in conditions that arent compatible with planet
formation.So if thats the case, what about the planets found around PSR
1257+12? This pulsar may actually be somewhat unique, in that it was
born with an unusually weak magnetic field. This birth defect might have
allowed it to form a fallback disk and, subsequently, planets where the
sample of energetic pulsars studied here could not.CitationM. Kerr et

<dc:description>The ability to detect small and localized movements of geotechnical
facilities is important for performance monitoring and early-warning
hazard detection. Current deformation monitoring technology is limited
in its ability to both scan massive structures and detect small and
localized movements. Ground-based interferometric radar (GBIR) is an
emerging remote sensing technology that has the potential to fill this
gap in surface deformation monitoring technology. Much of the focus of
previous research and application of GBIR has been on monitoring large
spatial scale movements, such as mine walls, dams, and earth slopes
experiencing deformational movements occurring over hundreds or
thousands of square meters. In this study the focus is on evaluating the
capabilities of GBIR for detecting and monitoring small movements (mm-
scale) occurring over very localized regions (a few m2). Specifically,
this study focused on the application of GBIR for detecting and
monitoring movements of individual boulders in a massive landscape. The
potential long-term application is to use GBIR to detect and monitor
precursor movements to rockfall events. Boulders, ranging from 0.5 to 5
meters in approximate facial dimensions, were moved using pry bars and
airbag jacks in increments of a few to several mm. Two identical GBIR
devices positioned at separate locations scanned a region covering
approximately 20,000 m2 after each boulder movement. Ground truth
measurements were also performed after each boulder movement. The
detectability of the boulder movements was assessed by comparing the
distribution of measured phase values from the boulder to (1) phase
values measured on the surrounding non-moving portion of the image and
(2) phase values measured from the same boulder when it was not moving.
The results from the study showed that movements of boulders with
dimensions larger than about 2 m were detectable for range offset
distances from about 75 to 150 m. Movements as small of 1.7 mm were
detected on these larger boulders. Phase values associated with
movements of the smaller boulders, with dimensions less than about 2 m,
were more difficult to differentiate from the non-moving portions of the
image. This study successfully demonstrated the potential of GBIR to
fill existing gaps in current displacement and deformation monitoring
technology for geotechnical applications.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Recent works show that the restframe colours of X-ray selected AGN host
galaxies at z~1 are no different from those of inactive galaxies once
stellar mass selection effects are taken into account. However, there is
a clear deficit of AGN among quiescent galaxies, and the average star
formation rates of AGN hosts are comparable or higher than those of
inactive star-forming galaxies. These apparently contradictory findings
could be a consequence of higher extinction in star-forming AGN hosts
compensating for their younger stellar populations in observed colours.
In this talk I will present a new method of extinction correction that
breaks the degeneracy with stellar age and metallicity by comparing the
restframe U-V colour with measurements of the Dn(4000) index on
intermediate band photospectra from SHARDS. I'll show that the
distribution of extinction corrected U-V colours and Dn(4000) for AGN
hosts at z&lt;1 is significantly different from that of comparison samples
of inactive galaxies, with a clear deficit of AGN in intrinsic red
galaxies and a higher prevalence among those with intermediate age
stellar populations.</dc:description>

resolve high-density peaks in the particle distribution and a nearest
grid point force-calculation scheme based on the second derivatives of
the potential. The code implements a fast low-storage FFT-algorithm and
allows a highly resolved treatment of interactions in clusters of
galaxies, such as high-velocity encounters between elliptical galaxies
and the tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies, as sub-grids follow the
trajectories of individual galaxies. SUPERBOX is efficient in that the
computational overhead is kept as slim as possible and is also memory
efficient since it uses only one set of grids to treat galaxies in
succession.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Low Frequency All Sky Monitor (LoFASM) is a distributed array of
dipole antennas that are sensitive to radio frequencies from 10 to 88
MHz. The primary science goals of LoFASM are the detection and study of
low-frequency radio transients, a high priority science goal as deemed
by the National Research Council's decadal survey. LoFASM consists of
antennas and front-end electronics that were originally developed for
the Long Wavelength Array (LWA) by the U.S. Naval Research Lab, the
University of New Mexico, Virginia Tech, and the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory. LoFASM, funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, will
initially consist of four stations, each consisting of 12 dual-
polarization dipole antennas. In a single station, RF signals from each
of the individual LoFASM dipoles are combined in phase in order to
synthesize LoFASM's beam. The LoFASM RF signals are phased up so that
the resulting beam is sensitive to radio emission that originates from
the zenith and RF signals approaching from the horizon are attenuated.
Digitally, this is achieved using a full Stokes 100MHz correlating
spectrometer constructed using field programmable gate array (FPGA)
technology. In this thesis I will describe the design and usage of the
LoFASM Correlator.</dc:description>

astrometry is provided by the &lt;A href="http://ascl.net/1606.002"&gt;PAL&lt;/A&gt;
(ascl:1606.002) and &lt;A href="http://ascl.net/1403.026"&gt;SOFA&lt;/A&gt;
(ascl:1403.026) libraries. AST bindings are available in Python (pyast),
Java (JNIAST) and Perl (Starlink::AST). AST is used as the plotting and
astrometry library in DS9 and GAIA, and is distributed separately and as
part of the Starlink software collection.</dc:description>

<abstract>Accurate flux calibration for the STIS echelle modes is heavily
dependent on the proper alignment of the blaze function for each
spectral order. However, due to changes in the instrument alignment over
time and between exposures, the blaze function can shift in wavelength.
This may result in flux calibration inconsistencies of up to 10%. We
present the stisblazefix Python module as a tool for STIS users to
correct their echelle spectra. The stisblazefix module assumes that the
error in the blaze alignment is a linear function of spectral order, and
finds the set of shifts that minimizes the flux inconsistencies in the
overlap between spectral orders. We discuss the uses and limitations of
this tool, and show that its use can provide significant improvements to
the default pipeline flux calibration for many observations.</abstract>

<abstract>The fluxes of &lt;SUP&gt;3&lt;/SUP&gt;He, &lt;SUP&gt;4&lt;/SUP&gt;He, C, O, and Fe ions at low
energies (about 0.04 - 2 MeV/nucleon) are studied during quiet periods
in Solar Cycles (SC) 23 and 24 using data from the ULEIS/ACE instrument.
In selecting quiet periods (the definition is given in Section 2.1),
additional data from EPHIN/SOHO and EPAM/ACE were also used. The
analysis of the ion energy spectra and their relative abundances shows
that their behavior is governed by their first-ionization potential.
Substantial differences in the ion energy spectra in two consecutive
solar cycles are observed during the quiet periods selected. Quiet-time
fluxes are divided into three distinct types according to the {̃} 80 -
320 keV/nucleon Fe/O ratio. Our results confirm the earlier observation
that these types of suprathermal particles have different origins, that
is, they represent different seed populations that are accelerated by
different processes. Except for the solar activity minimum, the Fe/O
ratio during quiet-time periods correspond either to the abundances of
ions in particle fluxes accelerated in impulsive solar flares or to the
mean abundances of elements in the solar corona. At the activity
minimum, this ratio takes on values that are characteristic for the
solar wind. These results indicate that the background fluxes of low-
energy particles in the ascending, maximum, and decay phases of the
solar cycle include significant contributions from both coronal
particles accelerated to suprathermal energies and ions accelerated in
small impulsive solar flares rich in Fe, while the contribution of
remnants from earlier SEP events cannot be excluded. The comparison of
suprathermal ion abundances during the first five years of SC 23 and SC
24 suggests that the quiet-time and non-quiet fluxes of Fe and
&lt;SUP&gt;3&lt;/SUP&gt;He were lower in SC 24.</abstract>

<abstract>We present a speckle survey of Hipparcos visual doubles and
spectroscopic binary stars identified by the Geneva-Copenhagen
spectroscopic survey with the SOAR 4m telescope + HRCam. These systems
represent our best chance to take advantage of Gaia parallaxes for the
purpose of stellar mass determinations. Many of these systems already
have mass fractions (although generally no spectroscopic orbit - an
astrometric orbit will determine individual masses), metallicity
information, and Hipparcos distances. They will be used to improve our
knowledge of the mass-luminosity relation, particularly for lower-
metallicity stars. Our survey will create the first all-sky, volume-
limited, speckle archive for the two primary samples, complementing a
similar effort that has been recently been completed at the WIYN 3.5-m
telescope in the Northern Hemisphere. This extension to the Southern
Hemisphere will fill out the picture for a wider metallicity range.</abstract>

<abstract>We show that in any spacetime dimension D ≥ 4, degenerate components of
the event horizon do not exist in static vacuum configurations with
positive cosmological constant. We also show that without a cosmological
constant asymptotically flat solutions cannot possess a degenerate
horizon component. Several independent proofs are presented. One proof
follows easily from differential geometry in the near-horizon limit,
while others use Bakry-Émery-Ricci bounds for static Einstein manifolds.</abstract>

<abstract>Due to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration and its effect on global
climates, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
proposes a Clean Power Plan (CPP) mandating CO2 reductions which will
likely force the early retirement of inefficient, aging power plants.
Consequentially, removing these plants equates to a shortfall of
approximately 66 GW of electricity. These factors add to the looming
resource problems of choosing whether to build large replacement power
plants or consider alternative energy sources as a means to help close
the gap between electricity supply and demand in a given region. One
energy source, shallow water tidal currents, represents opportunities to
convert kinetic energy to mechanical forms and provide electricity to
homes and businesses. Nearly 2,000 National Oceanic Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) tidal current data points from Maine to Texas are
considered. This paper, based on systems engineering thinking, provides
key attributes (e.g. turbine efficiency, array size, transmission
losses) for consideration as decision makers seek to identify where to
site Marine Hydrokinetic (MHK) systems and the number of homes powered
by the practical harvest of electricity from tidal currents at those
locations with given attributes. A systems engineering process model is
proposed for consideration as is a regression based equation to estimate
MHK machine parameters needed for power a given number of homes.</abstract>

<abstract>This spectacular composite (click here for the full image) reveals the
galaxy cluster 1RXS J0603.3+4214, known as the Toothbrush cluster due to
the shape of its most prominent radio relic. Featured in a recent
publication led by Kamlesh Rajpurohit (Thuringian State Observatory,
Germany), this image contains new Very Large Array (VLA) 1.5-GHz
observations (red) showing the radio emission within the cluster. This
is composited with a Chandra view of the X-ray emitting gas of the
cluster (blue) and an optical image of the background from Subaru data.
The new deep VLA data totaling 26 hours of observations provides a
detailed look at the complex structure within the Toothbrush relic,
revealing enigmatic filaments and twists (see below). This new data will
help us to explore the possible merger history of this cluster, which is
theorized to have caused the unusual shapes we see today. For more
information, check out the original article linked below.High resolution

<abstract>The observed evolution of the broad-band spectral energy distribution
(SED) in NS X-ray Nova Aql X-1 during the rise phase of a bright Fast-
Rise-Exponential-Decay-type outburst in 2013 can be understood in the
framework of thermal emission from non-stationary accretion disc with
radial temperature distribution transforming from a single-temperature
blackbody emitting ring into the multicolour irradiated accretion disc.
SED evolution during the hard to soft X-ray state transition looks
unusual, as it cannot be reproduced by the standard disc irradiation
model with a single irradiation parameter for NUV, Optical and NIR
spectral bands. NIR (NUV) band is correlated with soft (hard) X-ray flux
changes during the state transition interval, respectively. In our
interpretation, at the moment of X-ray state transition UV-emitting
parts of the accretion disc are screened from direct X-ray illumination
from the central source and are heated primarily by hard X-rays (E &gt; 10
keV), scattered in the hot corona or wind possibly formed above the
optically thick outer accretion flow; the outer edge of multicolour
disc, which emits in Optical-NIR, can be heated primarily by direct
X-ray illumination. We point out that future simultaneous
multiwavelength observations of X-ray Nova systems during the fast X-ray
state transition interval are of great importance, as it can serve as
'X-ray tomograph' to study physical conditions in outer regions of
accretion flow. This can provide an effective tool to directly test the
energy-dependent X-ray heating efficiency, vertical structure and
accretion flow geometry in transient low-mass X-ray binaries.</abstract>

<abstract>The Karl Schwarzschild Meeting 2017 (KSM2017) has been the third
instalment of the conference dedicated to the great Frankfurter
scientist, who derived the first black hole solution of Einstein's
equations about 100 years ago. The event has been a 5 day meeting in the
field of black holes, AdS/CFT correspondence and gravitational physics.
Like the two previous instalments, the conference continued to attract a
stellar ensemble of participants from the world's most renowned
institutions. The core of the meeting has been a series of invited talks
from eminent experts (keynote speakers) as well as the presence of
plenary research talks by students and junior speakers.</abstract>

<abstract>The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover carries a suite of
meteorological detectors that constitute the Rover Environmental
Monitoring Station (REMS) instrument. REMS investigates the
meteorological conditions at Gale crater by obtaining high-frequency
data of pressure, air and ground temperature, relative humidity, UV flux
at the surface and wind intensity and direction with some limitations in
the wind data. We have run a search of atmospheric pressure drops of
short duration (&lt; 25 s) and we present a statistical study of the
frequency of these events in the REMS pressure data during its first
1417 sols (more than two Martian years). The identified daytime pressure
drops could be caused by the close passages of warm vortices and dust
devils. Previous systematic searches of warm vortices from REMS pressure
data (Kahanpää et al., 2016; Steakley and Murphy, 2016) cover about one
Martian year. We show that sudden pressure drops are twice more abundant
in the second Martian year [sols 671-1339] than in the first one
analyzed in previous works. The higher number of detections could be
linked to a combination of different topography, higher altitudes (120 m
above the landing site) and true inter-annual meteorological
variability. We found 1129 events with a pressure drop larger than 0.5
Pa. Of these, 635 occurred during the local daytime (∼56%) and 494 were
nocturnal. The most intense pressure drop (4.2 Pa) occurred at daytime
on sol 1417 (areocentric solar longitude L&lt;SUB&gt;s&lt;/SUB&gt; = 195°) and was
accompanied by a simultaneous decrease in the UV signal of 7.1%,
pointing to a true dust devil. We also discuss similar but less intense
simultaneous pressure and UV radiation drops that constitute 0.7% of all
daytime events. Most of the intense daytime pressure drops with
variations larger than 1.0 Pa occur when the difference between air and
ground temperature is larger than 15 K. Statistically, the frequency of
daytime pressure drops peaks close to noon (12:00-13:00 Local True Solar
Time or LTST) with more events in spring and summer (L&lt;SUB&gt;s&lt;/SUB&gt; from
180° to 360°). The nocturnal sudden pressure drops concentrate in the
20:00-23:00 LTST time interval and they only occur in spring and summer.
We interpret these nocturnal events as a consequence of local
mechanically forced turbulence. This interpretation is consistent with
published results from simulations with the MRAMS model (Rafkin et al.,
2016) that predict a competition between local orographic circulation
and global Hadley cell circulation at Gale crater at summer night-time
that can enhance forced turbulence at the surface. Bursts of pressure
drops appear on particular sols, especially at night-time. Most of the
vortex bursts occurred when MSL was in the region called Pahrump Hills
characterized by a complex terrain. A comparison of the daytime pressure
drops from REMS data with published results from the Pathfinder and
Phoenix missions shows that the frequency of daytime events at Gale
crater in spring and summer is similar to the one previously found at
other locations. Finally, we present possible correlations between MSL
activity and some daytime pressure drops. If such an instrumental effect
is present in the REMS data its impact in this analysis is small and
would only affect about 7% of our detections.</abstract>

<abstract>We investigate the orbital stability of a test particle motion in the
restricted three-body problem where all bodies have their own rotation.
We have shown that it is possible to get some insight into the stability
properties of the motion of test particles in restricted three-body
problem, without knowing the exact solutions of the relativistic motion
equations.</abstract>

<abstract>It has been shown by van den Berg and Steif that the sub-critical Ising
model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ is a finitary factor of a finite-valued i.i.d.
process. We strengthen this by showing that the factor map can be made
to have finite expected coding volume (in fact, stretch-exponential
tails), answering a question of van den Berg and Steif. The result holds
at any temperature above the critical temperature. An analogous result
holds for Markov random fields satisfying a high-noise assumption and
for proper colorings with a large number of colors.</abstract>

<abstract>CCAT-prime is a 6-m submillimeter telescope that is being built on the
top of Cerro Chajnantor (5600 m altitude) overlooking the ALMA plateau
in the Atacama Desert. Its novel Crossed-Dragone design enables a large
field of view without blockage and is thus particularly well suited for
large scale surveys in the continuum and spectral lines targeting
important questions ranging from star formation in the Milky Way to
cosmology. On this poster, we focus on the large scale mapping
opportunities in important spectral cooling lines of the interstellar
medium opened up by CCAT-prime and the Cologne heterodyne instrument
CHAI.</abstract>

<abstract>This work is the first study on the 3D shape of starbursting extremely
metal-poor galaxies (XMPs; a galaxy is said to be an XMP if its ionized
gas-phase metallicity is less than 1/10 the solar value). A few hundred
XMPs have been identified in the local universe primarily through mining
the spectroscopic catalog of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and
follow-up observations have shown that metallicity drops significantly
at the starburst (compared to the quiescent component of the galaxy). As
the timescale for gas mixing is short, the metal-poor gas triggering the
starburst must have been accreted recently. This is strong observational
evidence for the cold flow accretion predicted by cosmological models of
galaxy formation, and, in this respect, XMPs seem to be the best local
analogs of the very first galaxies.The ellipsoidal shape of a class of
galaxies can be inferred from the observed axial ratio (q) distribution
(q = minor axis/major axis) of a large sample of randomly-oriented
galaxies. Fitting ellipses to 200 XMPs using r-band SDSS images, we
observe that the axial ratio distribution falls off at q &lt; ~0.4 and q &gt;
~0.8, and we determine that these falloffs are not due to biases in the
data. The falloff at low axial ratio indicates that the XMPs are thick
for their size, and the falloff at high axial ratio suggests the vast
majority of XMPs are triaxial. We also observe that smaller XMPs are
thicker in proportion to their size, and it is expected that for
decreasing galaxy size the ratio of random to rotational motions
increases, which correlates with increasing relative thickness. The XMPs
are low-redshift dwarf galaxies dominated by dark matter, and our
results are compatible with simulations that have shown dark matter
halos to be triaxial, with triaxial stellar distributions for low-mass
galaxies and with triaxiality increasing over time. We will offer
precise constraints on the 3D shape of XMPs via Bayesian analysis of our
observed axial ratio distribution.This work has been supported by the La
Caixa Foundation and the Estallidos Spanish Ministry of Science and
Innovation grant.</abstract>

<abstract>We adopted the predicted parallaxes for the 158 eclipsing binaries (EBs)
included in the study of Stassun &amp; Torres (2016, arXiv:1609.02579). Of
these, 116 had parallaxes available in the Gaia first data release (see
I/337). We excluded from our analysis any EBs identified as potentially
problematic in Stassun &amp; Torres (2016). This left 111 EBs with good
parallaxes from both the EB analysis and from Gaia. (1 data file).</abstract>

<abstract>Studies in the last 10 years of dust formation in core-collapse
supernovae (CCSNe) have found only small amounts, 0.001 solar masses.
This is far less than the amount needed to account for the large masses
of dust seen in some high redshift galaxies. However, the recent
discovery of 1 solar mass of cold dust in the ejecta of SN 1987A has has
caused a complete re-evaluation of dust formation in CCSNe. It has been
suggested that the CCSNe are continuously forming dust so that by the
time they are about 25 years old they will have dust masses similar to
SN 1987A. However, there is a wide time gap between the CCSNe that have
been studied recently and SN 1987A. We plan to use the sensitivity of
Spitzer to detect dust emission from SN 2017eaw at two epochs less than
a year after explosion. Radiative transfer models will be used to
estimate the dust masses. These observations will provide a necessary
baseline for our proposed JWST DD ERS observations. This is part of a
long term study to look for evidence of continuous dust formation in
CCSNe. These observations will help shed light on the mystery of dust in
the early universe. SSC Note: A 2019 epoch was added by the TAC.</abstract>

<abstract>We investigate the scaling properties of EUV intensity fluctuations seen
in low-latitude coronal holes (CH) and in regions of Quiet Sun (QS), in
signals obtained with the SDO/AIA instrument in the 193 Å waveband.
Contemporaneous time series in the 171 and 211 Å wavebands are used for
comparison among emissions at different heights in the transition region
and low corona. Potential-field extrapolations of contemporaneous
SDO/HMI line-of-sight magnetic fields provide a context in the physical
environment. Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) shows that the
variance of the fluctuations obeys a power-law as a function of temporal
scales with periods in the range ~15-60 min. This scaling is
characterized by a generalized Hurst exponent α. In QS regions, and in
regions within CHs that include magnetic bipoles, the scaling exponent
lies in the range 1.0 &lt; α &lt; 1.5, and it thus corresponds to anti-
correlated, turbulent-like, dynamical processes. Regions inside the
coronal holes primarily associated with magnetic field of a dominant
single polarity, have a generalized exponent (0.5 &lt; α &lt; 1) corresponding
to positively correlated (“persistent”) processes. The results indicate
the influence of the magnetic fields on the dynamics of the emission.</abstract>

<abstract>Flares are thought to be sudden releases of magnetic energy stored
around starspots. Recent space high-precision photometry shows
“superflares”, 10-10&lt;SUP&gt;4&lt;/SUP&gt; times more energetic than the largest
solar flares, occur on many G, K, M-type stars (e.g., Maehara+2012
Nature). Harmful UV/X-ray radiation and high-energy particles such as
protons are caused by such superflares. This may suggest that exoplanet
host stars have severe effects on the physical and chemical evolution of
exoplanetary atmospheres (cf. Segura+2010 Astrobiology, Takahashi+2016
ApJL).We here present statistical properties of superflares on G, K,
M-type stars on the basis of our analyses of Kepler photometric data
(Maehara+2012 Nature, Shibayama+2013 ApJS, Notsu+2013 ApJ,
Canderaresi+2014 ApJ, Maehara+2015 EPS, Maehara+2017 PASJ). We found
more than 5000 superflares on 800 G, K, M-type main-sequence stars, and
the occurrence frequency (dN/dE) of superflares as a function of flare
energy (E) shows the power-law distribution with the index of -1.8 -1.9.
This power-law distribution is consistent with that of solar
flares.Flare frequency increases as stellar temperature decreases. As
for M-type stars, energy of the largest flares is smaller compared with
G,K-type stars, but more frequent “hazardous” flares for the habitable
planets since the habitable zone around M-type stars is much smaller
compared with G, K-type stars.Rotation period and starspot coverage can
be estimated from the quasi-periodic brightness variation of the
superflare stars. The intensity of Ca II 8542 line of superflare stars,
which is measured from spectroscopic observations with Subaru Telescope,
has a well correlation with the brightness variation amplitude
(Notsu+2015a&amp;b PASJ).Flare frequency has a correlation with rotation
period, and this suggests young rapidly-rotating stars (like “young
Sun”) have more severe impacts of flares on the planetary atmosphere
(cf. Airapetian+2016 ApJL). Flare energy and frequency also depends on
starspot coverage, and this suggests existence of large starspots is
important factor of superflares.These statistical properties of
superflares discussed here can be one of the basic information for
considering the impacts of flares on planet-host stars.</abstract>

In a 2011 paper, Paul Warren (University of California, Los Angeles)
showed that there is a clear dichotomy in chromium and titanium isotopic
compositions between carbonaceous chondrites and all the other types of
stony meteorites, plus Earth, Moon, and Mars. Thomas Kruijer (Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, California and University of Münster,
Germany) and colleagues at the University of Münster now show that the
dichotomy involves iron meteorites as well as rocky ones. The two
distinct groups were nicknamed the CC (those with isotopes like
carbonaceous chondrites) and NC (those with isotopes like non-
carbonaceous meteorites). Kruijer and colleagues were able to determine
the time of core formation in the planetesimals in which iron meteorites
formed and report that CC iron meteorites formed 2.2 to 2.8 million
years after CAI formation, whereas the NC iron meteorites formed
earlier, before 1.8 million years after CAIs. (CAIs, calcium-aluminum-
rich inclusions, are the first solids to form in the Solar System and
give us a time-zero reference marker.) The accretion of the
planetesimals preceded core formation. Thermal calculations done by
Kruijer and colleagues indicate that NC objects accreted at 0.4 million
years after CAIs. In contrast, the CC objects accreted at 0.9 million
years after CAIs. Kruijer and colleagues suggest on the basis of their
results and published models for the formation of Jupiter that the
dichotomy resulted from Jupiter's formation. The NC materials accreted
when there was a continuous gas disk characterized by solids flowing
inwards towards the Sun. However, less than a million years later,
something interrupted this continuous flow, leading to formation of the
isotopic dichotomy. Kruijer and coworkers suggest that rapid accretion
of Jupiter's solid, mostly rocky core was the event that disrupted the
continuous inwards flow. Models suggest that Jupiter would have grown to
about 20 Earth masses, after which it grew by accreting gases to it. The
ages of the NC and CC iron meteorite groups indicate that Jupiter's
rocky core formed about 1 million years after CAIs. Sophisticated models
for planetary accretion predict early formation of the rocky core of
Jupiter, but suggest this process took between 1 and 10 million years
(after CAIs). Quantitative meteorite data show that the time was around
a million years, providing useful input for improving the models and
showing the value of combining theory with data on ancient samples.</abstract>

<abstract>Fluctuations are one of the main probes of the physics of the new state
of hot and dense nuclear matter called the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP)
which is created in the ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. In this
dissertation we extend and improve upon the existing descriptions of
heavy ion collisions in three different directions: we study the new
signatures of initial state fluctuations, the propagation of
perturbations in the early stages of the collision, and the effect of
thermal fluctuations on the hydrodynamic expansion of the QGP. First, in
Chapter 3 we study initial state fluctuations by examining the complete
statistical information contained in the two-particle correlation
measurements in hydrodynamic simulations of Pb+Pb collisions at the CERN
Large Hadron Collider (√sNN = 2.76 TeV). We use Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) to decompose the spectrum of harmonic flow, v_n(p_T) for
n = 0-5, into dominant components. The leading component is identified
with the standard event plane vn(pT), while the subleading component
describes additional fluctuations in the two-particle correlation
function. We find good geometric predictors for the orientation and the
magnitude of the leading and the subleading flows. The subleading v 0,
v1, and v3 flow harmonics are shown to be a response to the radial
excitation of the corresponding eccentricity epsilonn. In contrast, for
v2 the subleading flow in peripheral collisions is dominated by the
nonlinear mixing between the leading elliptic flow and radial flow
fluctuations. Nonlinear mixing also plays a significant role in
generating subleading v4 and v 5 harmonics. The PCA gives a systematic
way of studying the full information of the two-particle correlation
matrix and identifying the subleading flows, which we show are
responsible for factorization breaking in hydrodynamics. Second, in
Chapter 4 we study the thermalization and hydrodynamization of
fluctuations at the early stages of heavy ion collisions. We use leading
order effective kinetic theory, accurate at weak coupling, to simulate
the pre-equilibrium evolution of transverse energy and flow
perturbations. For the short evolution we can use a linear response
theory to construct the pre-equilibrium Green functions. Then the
energy-momentum tensor at a time when hydrodynamics becomes applicable
can be expressed as a linear convolution of response functions with the
initial perturbations. We propose combining effective kinetic theory
with weak coupling initial state models, such as IP-Glasma, to model the
complete pre-thermal evolution from saturated nuclei to hydrodynamics in
a weak coupling framework. Last, in Chapter 5 we consider out-of-
equilibrium hydrodynamic fluctuations in the expanding QGP. We develop a
set of kinetic equations for a correlator of thermal fluctuations which
are equivalent to nonlinear hydrodynamics with noise. We first show that
the kinetic response precisely reproduces the one-loop renormalization
of the shear viscosity for a static fluid. We then use the hydro-kinetic
equations to analyze thermal fluctuations for a Bjorken expansion. The
steady state solution to the kinetic equations determine the coefficient
of the first fractional power of the gradient expansion (infinity 1/(tau
T)3/2), which was computed here for the first time. The formalism of
hydro-kinetic equations can be applied to more general background flows
and coupled to existing viscous hydrodynamic codes to incorporate the
physics of hydrodynamic fluctuations.</abstract>

<abstract>How do magnetic fields form and evolve in early galaxies? A new study
has provided some clever observations to help us answer this
question.The Puzzle of Growing FieldsDynamo theory is the primary model
describing how magnetic fields develop in galaxies. In this picture,
magnetic fields start out as weak seed fields that are small and
unordered. These fields then become ordered and amplified by large-scale
rotation and turbulence in galaxy disks and halos, eventually leading to
the magnetic fields we observe in galaxies today.Schematic showinghow to
indirectly measure protogalactic magnetic fields. The measured
polarization of a background quasar is altered by the fields in a
foreground protogalaxy. Click for a closer look! [Farnes et al.
2017/Adolf Schaller/STSCI/NRAO/AUI/NSF]To test this model, we need
observations of the magnetic fields in young protogalaxies.
Unfortunately, we dont have the sensitivity to be able to measure these
fields directly but a team of scientists led by Jamie Farnes (Radboud
University in the Netherlands) have come up with a creative
alternative.The key is to find early protogalaxies that absorb the light
of more distant background objects. If a protogalaxy lies between us and
a distant quasar, then magnetic fields of the protogalaxy if present
will affect the polarization measurements of the background
quasar.Observing Galactic Building BlocksTop: Redshift distribution for
the background quasars in the authors sample. Bottom: Redshift
distribution for the foreground protogalaxies the authors are exploring.
[Farnes et al. 2017]Farnes and collaborators examined two types of
foreground protogalaxies: Damped Lyman-Alpha Absorbers (DLAs) and Lyman
Limit Systems (LLSs). They obtained polarimetric data for a sample of
114 distant quasars with nothing in the foreground (the control sample),
19 quasars with DLAs in the foreground, and 27 quasars with LLSs in the
foreground. They then used statistical analysis techniques to draw
conclusions about the magnetic fields in the foreground
protogalaxies.Farnes and collaborators were unable to detect either
coherent or random magnetic fields in DLAs. LLSs, however, showed some
evidence of coherent magnetic fields and significant evidence of
incoherent magnetic fields. The observations show that the magnetized
gas in LLSs must be highly turbulent on a scale of 520 parsecs similar
to turbulence scales in the Milky Way.Support for DynamosWhat do these
observations imply? Both support the dynamo theory of magnetic field
growth in galaxies!Polarization fraction distributions (top) and their
logarithms (bottom) for sources with and without protogalaxies in the
foreground (pink for DLAs, blue for LLSs, and grey for no intervenor).
Statistical analysis reveals that the distribution for LLSs differs from
the control sample, indicating the presence of magnetized gas. [Adapted
from Farnes et al. 2017]The DLAs appear to consist of mostly non-
turbulent quiescent gas; no dynamo action is currently occurring in
these protogalaxies. The LLSs, on the other hand, appear to be growing
their random magnetic fields via a turbulent dynamo. Thefields have not
yet had enough time to become ordered like the fields of more evolved
galaxies, however.Farnes and collaborators data indicate that magnetic
fields are indeed being gradually built up in early galaxies by dynamos.
They also suggest that DLAs may represent an earlier galactic
evolutionary stage than LLSs, as DLAs havent yet had the time to develop
their magnetic fields to a detectable level.A future increase in sample
size will certainly help improve our understanding of the field
formation process. In the meantime, the data in this study provide the
first observational picture of magnetic field evolution in galaxies,
lending excellent support to theoretical models.CitationJ. S. Farnes et

<abstract>Hurricane Bonnie (1998) was an unusually resilient hurricane that
maintained intensity in 12-16 ms-1 vertical wind shear and during an
eyewall replacement cycle from 23-25 August. This remarkable behavior
was examined using observations from flight-level data, microwave
imagery, radar, and dropsondes over the two-day period. The symmetric
and asymmetric aspects of Bonnie's eyewall replacement cycle were
documented and compared to eyewall replacement cycles in other
hurricanes. Similar to other observed eyewall replacement cycles, Bonnie
exhibited the development, strengthening, and dominance of a secondary
eyewall while a primary eyewall decayed. However, Bonnie's structure was
highly asymmetric due to strong 12-16 ms-1 vertical wind shear, in
contrast to the more symmetric structures observed in other hurricanes
undergoing eyewall replacement cycles. It is hypothesized that strong
shear preferentially forced convection downshear, which was able to
extend upshear and form a secondary eyewall through enhanced surface
fluxes upshear. The larger radius of maximum winds after the eyewall
replacement cycle completed might have aided Bonnie's resiliency in
shear by increasing the likelihood that diabatic heating would fall
inside the radius of maximum winds. These observations of Hurricane
Bonnie's ability to maintain intensity in spite of high shear and an
eyewall replacement cycle, both of which usually result in weakening,
provide a new direction from which to view the intensity change issue in
hurricanes.</abstract>

<abstract>Icy grain mantles are the main reservoir for volatile elements in star-
forming regions across the Universe, as well as the formation site of
pre-biotic complex organic molecules (COMs) seen in our Solar System. We
propose to trace the evolution of pristine and complex ice chemistry in
a representative low-mass star-forming region through observations of a:
pre-stellar core, Class 0 protostar, Class I protostar, and
protoplanetary disk. Comparing high spectral resolution (R 1500-3000)
and sensitivity (S/N 100-300) observations from 3 to 15 um to template
spectra, we will map the spatial distribution of ices down to 20-50 AU
in these targets to identify when, and at what visual extinction, the
formation of each ice species begins. Such high-resolution spectra will
allow us to search for new COMs, as well as distinguish between
different ice morphologies,thermal histories, and mixing environments.
The analysis of these data will result in science products beneficial to
Cycle 2 proposers. A newly updated public laboratory ice database will
provide feature identifications for all of the expected ices, while a
chemical model fit to the observed ice abundances will be released
publically as a grid, with varied metallicity and UV fields to simulate
other environments. We will create improved algorithms to extract NIRCAM
WFSS spectra in crowded fields with extended sources as well as optimize
the defringing of MIRI LRS spectra in order to recover broad spectral
features. We anticipate that these resources will be particularly useful
for astrochemistry and spectroscopy of fainter, extended targets like
star forming regions of the SMC/LMC or more distant galaxies.</abstract>

<abstract>M dwarf stars are promising targets in the search for extrasolar
habitable planets, as their small size and close-in habitable zones make
the detection of Earth-analog planets easier than at Solar-type stars.
However, the effects of the high stellar activity of M dwarf hosts has
uncertain effects on such planets, and may render them uninhabitable.
Studying stellar activity at M dwarfs is hindered by a lack of
measurements of high-energy radiation, flare activity and, in
particular, stellar wind rates. We propose to rectify this by observing
a sample of Post Common Envelope Binaries (PCEBs) with HST and XMM-
Newton. PCEBs consist of an M dwarf with a white dwarf companion, which
experiences the same stellar wind and radiation environment as a close-
in planet. The stellar wind of the M dwarf accretes onto the otherwise
pure hydrogen atmosphere white dwarf, producing metal lines detectable
with ultraviolet spectroscopy. The metal lines can be used to measure
accretion rates onto the white dwarf, from with we can accurately infer
the stellar wind mass loss rate of the M dwarf, along with abundances of
key elements. Simultaneous observations with XMM-Newton will probe X-ray
flare occurrence rate and strength, in addition to coronal temperatures.
Performing these measurements over twelve PCEBs will provide a sample of
M dwarf stellar wind strengths, flare occurrence and X-ray/UV activity
that will finally shed light on the true habitability of planets around
small stars.</abstract>

<abstract>There are two books and one review paper that have been written about
the history of astronomy in Korea. Chronologically, they are the review
paper "Astronomy in Korea" (Rufus, Transactions of the Korea Branch of
the Royal Asiatic Society, XXVI, 1-69, 1936), and the books The Hall of
Heavenly Records, Korean Astronomical Instruments and Clocks 1380-1780
(Needham et al., Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1986a) and
History of Astronomy in Korea (Nha, Seoul National University Press,
Seoul, 2000). In order to overview the emergence and development of
modern astronomy and astrophysics in South Korea, much of the present
chapter is based on these three references, along with various papers
published by the present authors and other astronomers.</abstract>

<abstract>Program 14439 used the onboard deuterium lamp to illuminate the LP3
region of the COS FUV detector immediately before and after the nominal
high voltage on Segment B was changed on January 18, 2016. Exposures
were also taken at LP2 approximately one year after the previous LP2
gain maps were obtained. The pulse height information obtained was used
to create gain maps in order to monitor the detector gain sag and to
determine when high voltage changes and Lifetime Position changes were
needed.</abstract>

<abstract>Two apparently independent recoveries of comet P/2012 T1 (cf. CBET 3254)
have been reported. M. Mommert, Northern Arizona University, reports the
recovery of the comet as an apparently asteroidal object on g-band CCD
images taken by Mommert and J. Agarwal with the 4.1-m Southern
Astrophysical Research (SOAR) Cassegrain telescope at Cerro Pachon,
Chile, on July 28.2 UT. M. Micheli also reports recovery observations of
P/2012 T1 obtained by H. H. Hsieh, J. Chavez, L. Magill, and K. Silva
with the 8.1-m "Gemini South" telescope at Cerro Pachon on multiple
nights, the object again presumably appearing asteroidal. The available

<abstract>DMATIS (Dark Matter ATtenuation Importance Sampling) calculates the
trajectories of DM particles that propagate in the Earth's crust and the
lead shield to reach the DAMIC detector using an importance sampling
Monte-Carlo simulation. A detailed Monte-Carlo simulation avoids the
deficiencies of the SGED/KS method that uses a mean energy loss
description to calculate the lower bound on the DM-proton cross section.
The code implementing the importance sampling technique makes the brute-
force Monte-Carlo simulation of moderately strongly interacting DM with
nucleons computationally feasible. DMATIS is written in Python 3 and
MATHEMATICA.</abstract>

<abstract>This research was to design a 2.4 GHz class E Power Amplifier (PA) for
health care, with 0.18um Semiconductor Manufacturing International
Corporation CMOS technology by using Cadence software. And also RF
switch was designed at cadence software with power Jazz 180nm SOI
process. The ultimate goal for such application is to reach high
performance and low cost, and between high performance and low power
consumption design. This paper introduces the design of a 2.4GHz class E
power amplifier and RF switch design. PA consists of cascade stage with
negative capacitance. This power amplifier can transmit 16dBm output
power to a 50{\Omega} load. The performance of the power amplifier and
switch meet the specification requirements of the desired.</abstract>

<abstract>In 2016 we saw the first direct detections of gravitational waves by
Advanced LIGO and the positive results from LISA Pathfinder. In this
context, NASA has decided to partner with the ESA on their L3
gravitational wave observatory, whose science goals are outlined in the
white paper, The Gravitational Universe. The current launch date for L3
is 2034, but with the success of Pathfinder and the increased scientific
interest in gravitational waves caused by LIGO, ESA and its member
states are exploring ways to move up the launch date. In the U.S., the
National Academy's Astronomy Midterm Assessment has recommended that
NASA restore support for a gravitational wave mission in this decade
with the goal of realizing the full scientific capability of the mission
envisioned in the 2020 decadal. NASA has appointed the L3 Study Team,
charged with providing analysis of potential U.S. contributions to the
European-led L3 mission and preparing for the next decadal survey. The
LISA mission concept, proposed for L3, will improve our understanding of
the formation and growth of massive black holes, create a census of
compact binary systems in the Milky Way, test general relativity in
extreme conditions, provide predictions of black hole binary mergers in
the LIGO frequency band, and enable searches for new physics.</abstract>

<abstract>Modern data analysis methods such as photometric ubercalibration and
optimized mosaicing with background matching have enhanced the public
products of many large astronomical surveys, but unfortunately not yet
for the GALEX mission. This is significant because GALEX provided our
only view of the entire ultraviolet (UV) sky - a circumstance unlikely
to change for many years. We have recently achieved both these
calibration goals for a subset of the GALEX observations toward the
Magellanic Clouds, substantially increasing the quality and internal
consistency of the source catalogs and fidelity of the diffuse emission
morphology in this limited region. We propose to apply the same methods
to the entire public GALEX database, in order to eliminate remaining
discontinuities in the current photometry and step-like background
artifacts in sky maps. This work will have two principal products: (1)
the updated photometric catalog for all GALEX sources, and (2) a Legacy
all-sky coadd for both the FUV and NUV bands. Traditional GALEX pipeline
analysis only stacked exposures that were obtained as part of the same
planned survey tile. However, a substantial degree of overlap between
independent GALEX observations does exist and can used to produce a
deeper coadd over much of the sky. Redundant coverage also allows
artifacts such as internal reflections to be masked when stacking. Our
ADAP effort will ideally complement the all-sky unWISE reprocessing
project in infrared bands. We will publicly release all products as they
are produced. This project will positively impact both extragalactic and
Milky Way related science and is therefore relevant to a wide range of
NASA priorities.</abstract>

<abstract>For our census of the disk population in Taurus, we use images at 3.6,
4.5, 5.8, and 8.0um obtained with Spitzer's Infrared Array Camera (IRAC)
and images at 24um obtained with the Multiband Imaging Photometer for
Spitzer (MIPS). The cameras produced images with FWHM=1.6"-1.9" from 3.6
to 8.0um and FWHM=5.9" at 24um. The available data were obtained through
Guaranteed Time Observations for PID = 6, 36, 37 (G. Fazio), 53 (G.
Rieke), 94 (C. Lawrence), 30540 (G. Fazio, J. Houck), and 40302 (J.
Houck), Director's Discretionary Time for PID = 462 (L. Rebull), Legacy
programs for PID = 139, 173 (N. Evans), and 30816 (D. Padgett), and
General Observer programs for PID = 3584 (D. Padgett), 20302 (P. Andre),
20386 (P. Myers), 20762 (J. Swift), 30384 (T. Bourke), 40844 (C.
McCabe), and 50584 (D. Padgett). The IRAC and MIPS observations were
performed through 180 and 137 Astronomical Observation Requests (AORs),
respectively. The characteristics of the resulting images are summarized
in Tables 1 and 2. (6 data files).</abstract>

<abstract>The SkyMapper Early Data Release (EDR) is the initial data release from
the SkyMapper Southern Survey, which aims to create a deep, multi-epoch,
multi-band photometric data set for the entire southern sky. EDR covers
approximately 6700 sq. deg. (one-third) of the southern sky as obtained
by the Short Survey component of the project. All included fields have
at least two visits in good conditions in all six SkyMapper filters
(uvgriz). Object catalogues are complete to magnitude 17-18, depending
on filter. IVOA-complaint table access protocol (TAP), cone search and
simple image access protocol (SIAP) services are available from the
SkyMapper website (http://skymapper.anu.edu.au/), as well as through
tools such as TOPCAT. Data are restricted to Australian astronomers and
their collaborators for twelve months from the release date. Further
details on the reduction of SkyMapper data, along with data quality

<abstract>Fiber optic networks are no longer just pipelines for transporting data
in the long haul backbone. Exponential growth in traffic in metro-
regional areas has pushed higher capacity fiber toward the edge of the
network, and highly dynamic patterns of heterogeneous traffic have
emerged that are often bursty, severely stressing the historical "fat
and dumb pipe" static optical network, which would need to be massively
over-provisioned to deal with these loads. What is required is a more
intelligent network with a span of control over the optical as well as
electrical transport mechanisms which enables handling of service
requests in a fast and efficient way that guarantees quality of service
(QoS) while optimizing capacity efficiency. An "agile" optical network
is a reconfigurable optical network comprised of high speed intelligent
control system fed by real-time in situ network sensing. It provides
fast response in the control and switching of optical signals in
response to changing traffic demands and network conditions. This agile
control of optical signals is enabled by pushing switching decisions
downward in the network stack to the physical layer. Implementing such
agility is challenging due to the response dynamics and interactions of
signals in the physical layer. Control schemes must deal with issues
such as dynamic power equalization, EDFA transients and cascaded noise
effects, impairments due to self-phase modulation and dispersion, and
channel-to-channel cross talk. If these issues are not properly
predicted and mitigated, attempts at dynamic control can drive the
optical network into an unstable state. In order to enable high speed
actuation of signal modulators and switches, the network controller must
be able to make decisions based on predictive models. In this thesis, we
consider how to take advantage of Software Defined Networking (SDN)
capabilities for network reconfiguration, combined with embedded models
that access updates from deployed network monitoring sensors. In order
to maintain signal quality while optimizing network resources, we find
that it is essential to model and update estimates of the physical link
impairments in real-time. In this thesis, we consider the key elements
required to enable an agile optical network, with contributions as
follows: ∙ Control Framework: extended the SDN concept to include the
optical transport network through extensions to the OpenFlow (OF)
protocol. A unified SDN control plane is built to facilitate control and
management capability across the electrical/packet-switched and optical
/circuit-switched portions of the network seamlessly. The SDN control
plane serves as a platform to abstract the resources of
multilayer/multivendor networks. Through this platform, applications can
dynamically request the network resources to meet their service
requirements. ∙ Use of In-situ Monitors: enabled real-time physical
impairment sensing in the control plane using in-situ Optical
Performance Monitoring (OPM) and bit error rate (BER) analyzers. OPM and
BER values are used as quantitative indicators of the link status and
are fed to the control plane through a high-speed data collection
interface to form a closed-loop feedback system to enable adaptive
resource allocation. ∙ Predictive Network Model: used a network model
embedded in the control layer to study the link status. The estimated
results of network status is fed into the control decisions to
precompute the network resources. The performance of the network model
can be enhanced by the sensing results. ∙ Real-Time Control Algorithms:
investigated various dynamic resource allocation mechanisms supporting
an agile optical network. Intelligent routing and wavelength switching
for recovering from traffic impairments is achieved experimentally in
the agile optical network within one second. A distance-adaptive
spectrum allocation scheme to address transmission impairments caused by
cascaded Wavelength Selective Switches (WSS) is proposed and evaluated
for improving network spectral efficiency.</abstract>

<abstract>Coronal holes are where the fast solar wind streams out of the Suns
atmosphere, sending charged particles on rapid trajectories out into the
solar system. A new study examines how the distribution of coronal holes
has changed over the last 40 years.Coronal holes form where magnetic
field lines open into space (B) instead of looping back to the solar
surface (A). [Sebman81]Source of the Fast Solar WindAs a part of the
Suns natural activity cycle, extremely low-density regions sometimes
form in the solar corona. These coronal holes manifest themselves as
dark patches in X-ray and extreme ultraviolet imaging, since the corona
is much hotter than the solar surface that peeks through from underneath
it.Coronal holes form when magnetic field lines open into space instead
of looping back to the solar surface. In these regions, the solar
atmosphere escapes via these field lines, rapidly streaming away from
the Suns surface in whats known as the fast solar wind.Coronal Holes
Over Space and TimeAutomated detection of coronal holes from image-based
analysis is notoriously difficult. Recently, a team of scientists led by
Kenichi Fujiki (ISEE, Nagoya University, Japan) has developed an
automated prediction technique for coronal holes that relies instead on
magnetic-field data for the Sun, obtained at the National Solar
Observatorys Kitt Peak between 1975 and 2014. The team used these data
to produce a database of 3335 coronal hole predictions over nearly 40
years.Latitude distribution of 2870 coronal holes (each marked by an x;
color indicates polarity), overlaid on the magnetic butterfly map of the
Sun. The low-latitude coronal holes display a similar butterfly pattern,
in which they move closer to the equator over the course of the solar
cycle. Polar coronal holes are more frequent during solar minima.
[Fujiki et al. 2016]Examining trends in the coronal holes distribution
in latitude and time, Fujiki and collaborators find a strong correlation
between the total area covered by low-latitude coronal holes (holes
closer to the Suns equator) and sunspot activity. In contrast, the total
area of high-latitude coronal holes (those near the Suns poles) peaks
around the minimum in each solar cycle and shrinks around each solar
maximum.Predicting the Impact of the Solar WindWhy do these observations
matter? Coronal holes are the source of the fast solar wind, so if we
can better predict the frequency and locations of coronal holes in the
future, we can make better predictions about how the solar wind might
impact us here on Earth.Periodicity of high-latitude (orange) and low-
latitude (blue) coronal-hole areas, and periodicity of galactic cosmic
rays detected at Earth (black). The cosmic rays track the polar coronal-
hole area behavior with a 1-year time lag. [Fujiki et al. 2016]In one
example of this, Fujiki and collaborators show that theres a distinct
correlation between polar coronal-hole area and observed galactic cosmic
rays. Cosmic rays from within our galaxy have long been known to exhibit
a 22-year periodicity. Fujiki and collaborators show that the
periodicity of the galactic cosmic-ray activity tracks that of the polar
coronal-hole area, with a ~1-year lag time which is equivalent to the
propagation time of the solar wind to the termination shock.Polar
coronal holes are therefore a useful observable indicator of the dipole
component of the solar magnetic field, which modulates the incoming
cosmic rays entering our solar system. This coronal hole database will
be a useful tool for understanding the source of solar wind and the many
ways the wind influences the Earth and our solar system.CitationK.

<abstract>A systematic inspection of the far-infrared (FIR) properties of evolved
stars allows not only to constrain physical models, but also to
understand the chemical evolution that takes place in the end of their
lives. In this work we intend to study the circumstellar envelopes (CSE)
on a sample of stars in the THROES catalogue from AGB/post-AGB stars to
planetary nebulae using photometry and spectroscopy provided by the PACS
instrument on-board Herschel telescope. In the first part we are
interested in obtaining an estimate of the size of FIR emitting region
and to sort our targets in two classes: point-like and extended.
Secondly, we focus on the molecular component of the envelope traced by
carbon monoxide (CO) rotational lines. We conduct a line survey on a
sample of evolved stars by identifying and measuring flux of both 12CO
and 13CO isotopologues in the PACS range, while looking at the overall
properties of the sample. Lastly, we will be interested in obtaining
physical parameters of the CSE, namely gas temperature, mass and mass-
loss rate on a sample of carbon stars. For that, we make use of PACS
large wavelength coverage, which enables the simultaneous study of a
large number of CO transitions, to perform the rotational diagram
analysis. We report the detection of CO emission in a high number of
stars from the catalogue, which were mostly classified as point-like
targets with a few exceptions of planetary nebulae. High J rotational
number transitions were detected in a number of targets, revealing the
presence of a significant amount of hot gas (T ̃ 400-900 K) and high
mass-loss rates. We conclude that Herschel/PACS is in a privileged
position to detect a new population of warmer gas, typically missed in
sub-mm/mm observations.</abstract>

<abstract>PyPHER (Python-based PSF Homogenization kERnels) computes an
homogenization kernel between two PSFs; the code is well-suited for PSF
matching applications in both an astronomical or microscopy context. It
can warp (rotation + resampling) the PSF images (if necessary), filter
images in Fourier space using a regularized Wiener filter, and produce a
homogenization kernel. PyPHER requires the pixel scale information to be
present in the FITS files, which can if necessary be added by using the
provided ADDPIXSCL method.</abstract>

<abstract>A multiwavelength (radio and optical) observing campaign on SS Cyg is
underway, and AAVSO participation is urgently requested. An AAVSO Alert
Notice will be issued February 5 with full details. The purpose of this
Special Notice is to alert observers right now to the need to monitor SS
Cyg very closely and report your observations to the AAVSO via WebObs at
once. It is likely to go into outburst very soon, and immediate
reporting of outburst behavior is crucial to the success of the
campaign. Previous similar campaigns with Dr. James Miller-Jones and his
colleagues have been very successful. AAVSO observations are used to
trigger multi-site radio observations of SS Cyg in research on radio
emission from this dwarf nova, as well as for correlation with the radio
data during analysis. Visual and CCD/DSLR (particularly V) observations
are requested (no time series unless outburst is underway and radio
observations have been triggered). Its normal minimum magnitude is 11.8
V, but it can fluctuate to around 11.5. If it becomes brighter than 11.5
V, it could well be going into outburst. If it reaches 11.0, it is
almost certainly on its way up. Please report your observations of SS
Cyg to the AAVSO as soon after you make them as possible. If you see it
11.5 or brighter, please report them immediately. Finder charts with
sequence may be created using the AAVSO Variable Star Plotter
(https://www.aavso.org/vsp). Observations should be submitted to the
AAVSO International Database. See full Special Notice for more details.</abstract>

<abstract>Two research endeavors are described in this dissertation; both
undertake problems in solid-state astrophysics, which is a branch of
solid-state physics concerning the extreme conditions found within white
dwarfs and the solid crusts of neutron stars. As much of our knowledge
about these compact objects comes from observation of astrophysical
phenomena, Chapter 1 is devoted to the phenomena, and how they can be
exploited as material property probes. Several of the most interesting
phenomena involve the enormous magnetic fields (B ≥ 1012 gauss) harbored
by many neutron stars, and the interaction between these fields and the
charged particles within the solid crust. Accordingly, Chapter 2 reviews
some theory of strongly-magnetized electrons, which both sets the stage
for Chapter 3, and (hopefully) serves as a useful reference for future
research. Let it now be made clear that this dissertation focuses
exclusively on the "outer crusts," of neutron stars, where no free
neutrons are present (rho &lt; 4x1011 g/cc), and the similarly-composed
interiors of white dwarfs, which have central densities ̃ 107 g/cc. For
the most part we specialize to even lower densities. In Chapter 3,
static and dynamic properties of low density (rho ≥ 106 g/cc) outer
envelopes of neutron stars are calculated within the nonlinear magnetic
Thomas-Fermi model, assuming degenerate electrons. A novel domain
decomposition enables proper description of lattice symmetry and may be
seen as a prototype for the general class of problems involving
nonlinear charge screening of periodic, quasi-low-dimensionality
structures, e.g. liquid crystals. We describe a scalable implementation
of the method using Hypre. Over the density range considered, the
effective shear modulus appears to be a factor of ≈ 20 larger than in
the linearlyscreened Coulomb crystal model, which could have
implications for observables related to astroseismology as well as low
temperature phonon-mediated thermal conductivity. Other findings include
incipient c' &lt; 0 elastic instabilities for both bcc and fcc lattices,
reminiscent of the situation in some light actinides, and suggestive of
a symmetry-lowering transition to a tetragonal or orthorhombic lattice.
Chapter 4 describes a systematic search for multicomponent crystal
structures, carried out for five different ternary systems of nuclei in
a polarizable background of electrons, representative of accreted
neutron star crusts and some white dwarfs. Candidate structures are
"bred" by a genetic algorithm, and optimized at constant pressure under
the assumption of linear response (Thomas-Fermi) charge screening.
Subsequent phase equilibria calculations reveal eight distinct crystal
structures in the T = 0 bulk phase diagrams, five of which are
complicated multinary structures not before predicted in the context of
compact object astrophysics. Frequent instances of geometrically similar
but compositionally distinct phases give insight into structural
preferences of systems with pairwise Yukawa interactions, including and
extending to the regime of low density colloidal suspensions made in a
laboratory. As an application of these main results, we self-
consistently couple the phase stability problem to the equations for a
self-gravitating, hydrostatically stable white dwarf, with fixed overall
composition. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to incorporate
complex multinary phases into the equilibrium phase layering diagram and
mass-radius-composition dependence, both of which are reported for
He-C-O and C-O-Ne white dwarfs. Finite thickness interfacial phases
("interphases") show up at the boundaries between single-component bcc
crystalline regions, some of which have lower lattice symmetry than
cubic. A second application---quasi-static settling of heavy nuclei in
white dwarfs---builds on our equilibrium phase layering method. Tests of
this nonequilibrium method reveal extra phases which play the role of
transient host phases for the settling species.</abstract>

<abstract>Did you know that the very first exoplanets ever confirmed were found
around a pulsar? The precise timing measurements of pulsar PSR 1257+12
were what made the discovery of its planetary companions possible. Yet
surprisingly, though weve discovered thousands of exoplanets since then,
only one other planet has ever been confirmed around a pulsar. Now, a
team of CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science researchers are trying to
figure out why.Formation ChallengesThe lack of detected pulsar planets
may simply reflect the fact that getting a pulsar-planet system is
challenging! There are three main pathways:The planet formed before the
host star became a pulsar which means it somehow survived its star going
supernova (yikes!).The planet formed elsewhere and was captured by the
pulsar.The planet formed out of the debris of the supernova
explosion.The first two options, if even possible, are likely to be rare
occurrences but the third option shows some promise. In this scenario,
after the supernova explosion, a small fraction of the material falls
back toward the stellar remnant and is recaptured, forming what is known
as a supernova fallback disk. According to this model, planets could
potentially form out of this disk.Disk ImplicationsLed by Matthew Kerr,
the CSIRO astronomers set out to systematically look for these potential
planets that might have formed in situ around pulsars. They searched a
sample of 151 young, energetic pulsars, scouring seven years of pulse
time-of-arrival data for periodic variation that could signal the
presence of planetary companions. Their methods to mitigate pulsar
timing noise and model realistic orbits allowed them to have good
sensitivity to low-mass planets.The results? They found no conclusive
evidence that any of these pulsars have planets.This outcome carries
with it some significant implications. The pulsar sample spans 2 Myr in
age, in which planets should have had enough time to form in debris
disks. The fact that none were detected suggests that long-lived
supernova fallback disks may actually be much rarer than thought, or
they exist only in conditions that arent compatible with planet
formation.So if thats the case, what about the planets found around PSR
1257+12? This pulsar may actually be somewhat unique, in that it was
born with an unusually weak magnetic field. This birth defect might have
allowed it to form a fallback disk and, subsequently, planets where the
sample of energetic pulsars studied here could not.CitationM. Kerr et

<abstract>The ability to detect small and localized movements of geotechnical
facilities is important for performance monitoring and early-warning
hazard detection. Current deformation monitoring technology is limited
in its ability to both scan massive structures and detect small and
localized movements. Ground-based interferometric radar (GBIR) is an
emerging remote sensing technology that has the potential to fill this
gap in surface deformation monitoring technology. Much of the focus of
previous research and application of GBIR has been on monitoring large
spatial scale movements, such as mine walls, dams, and earth slopes
experiencing deformational movements occurring over hundreds or
thousands of square meters. In this study the focus is on evaluating the
capabilities of GBIR for detecting and monitoring small movements (mm-
scale) occurring over very localized regions (a few m2). Specifically,
this study focused on the application of GBIR for detecting and
monitoring movements of individual boulders in a massive landscape. The
potential long-term application is to use GBIR to detect and monitor
precursor movements to rockfall events. Boulders, ranging from 0.5 to 5
meters in approximate facial dimensions, were moved using pry bars and
airbag jacks in increments of a few to several mm. Two identical GBIR
devices positioned at separate locations scanned a region covering
approximately 20,000 m2 after each boulder movement. Ground truth
measurements were also performed after each boulder movement. The
detectability of the boulder movements was assessed by comparing the
distribution of measured phase values from the boulder to (1) phase
values measured on the surrounding non-moving portion of the image and
(2) phase values measured from the same boulder when it was not moving.
The results from the study showed that movements of boulders with
dimensions larger than about 2 m were detectable for range offset
distances from about 75 to 150 m. Movements as small of 1.7 mm were
detected on these larger boulders. Phase values associated with
movements of the smaller boulders, with dimensions less than about 2 m,
were more difficult to differentiate from the non-moving portions of the
image. This study successfully demonstrated the potential of GBIR to
fill existing gaps in current displacement and deformation monitoring
technology for geotechnical applications.</abstract>

<abstract>Recent works show that the restframe colours of X-ray selected AGN host
galaxies at z~1 are no different from those of inactive galaxies once
stellar mass selection effects are taken into account. However, there is
a clear deficit of AGN among quiescent galaxies, and the average star
formation rates of AGN hosts are comparable or higher than those of
inactive star-forming galaxies. These apparently contradictory findings
could be a consequence of higher extinction in star-forming AGN hosts
compensating for their younger stellar populations in observed colours.
In this talk I will present a new method of extinction correction that
breaks the degeneracy with stellar age and metallicity by comparing the
restframe U-V colour with measurements of the Dn(4000) index on
intermediate band photospectra from SHARDS. I'll show that the
distribution of extinction corrected U-V colours and Dn(4000) for AGN
hosts at z&lt;1 is significantly different from that of comparison samples
of inactive galaxies, with a clear deficit of AGN in intrinsic red
galaxies and a higher prevalence among those with intermediate age
stellar populations.</abstract>

<abstract>SUPERBOX is a particle-mesh code that uses moving sub-grids to track and
resolve high-density peaks in the particle distribution and a nearest
grid point force-calculation scheme based on the second derivatives of
the potential. The code implements a fast low-storage FFT-algorithm and
allows a highly resolved treatment of interactions in clusters of
galaxies, such as high-velocity encounters between elliptical galaxies
and the tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies, as sub-grids follow the
trajectories of individual galaxies. SUPERBOX is efficient in that the
computational overhead is kept as slim as possible and is also memory
efficient since it uses only one set of grids to treat galaxies in
succession.</abstract>

<abstract>The Low Frequency All Sky Monitor (LoFASM) is a distributed array of
dipole antennas that are sensitive to radio frequencies from 10 to 88
MHz. The primary science goals of LoFASM are the detection and study of
low-frequency radio transients, a high priority science goal as deemed
by the National Research Council's decadal survey. LoFASM consists of
antennas and front-end electronics that were originally developed for
the Long Wavelength Array (LWA) by the U.S. Naval Research Lab, the
University of New Mexico, Virginia Tech, and the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory. LoFASM, funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, will
initially consist of four stations, each consisting of 12 dual-
polarization dipole antennas. In a single station, RF signals from each
of the individual LoFASM dipoles are combined in phase in order to
synthesize LoFASM's beam. The LoFASM RF signals are phased up so that
the resulting beam is sensitive to radio emission that originates from
the zenith and RF signals approaching from the horizon are attenuated.
Digitally, this is achieved using a full Stokes 100MHz correlating
spectrometer constructed using field programmable gate array (FPGA)
technology. In this thesis I will describe the design and usage of the
LoFASM Correlator.</abstract>
